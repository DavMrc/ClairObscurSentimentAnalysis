"3","Spring Meadows","9","8","Lune","No, not yet. Protocol is to regroup at the Rally Point and wait three days. This message feels off. If it was an Expeditioner, they would have stayed here. Everyone knows the protocol.","0.6","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.4"

"3","Spring Meadows","9","12","Lune","There’s a REASON it’s protocol. We designed it to yield the optimal result in the vast majority of situations.","0.0","0.3","0.0","0.3","0.0","0.0","0.4"
"3","Spring Meadows","9","13","Gustave","Was our entire team dying part of that “optimal result?” Look. I’m going after Maelle. Protocol also states “Never move solo.” I’ll let you choose which protocol to break.","0.0","0.3","0.0","0.5","0.0","0.2","0.0"

"3","Spring Meadows","11","5","Lune","But right now, it’s just the two of us and I don’t want to bring Maelle your corpse. We have to think every step through. The man on the beach, you saw what he did. But more than that… You saw his face. He must be, what, 50? 60? Yet he survived the Gommage. We don’t know who we’re dealing with. We lost everyone in an instant–","0.4","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","0.1"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","6","Gustave","Exactly. He killed us all so easily, he doesn’t need to fake a message. Lucien– Lucien died to save me. And, and Tristan, Margot, they… they all… I am not letting Maelle die out here. I’m taking her home.","0.0","0.3","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.7","0.0"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","7","Lune","What, No, no, no. We have a mission–","0.0","0.6","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.4"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","8","Gustave","Oh, fuck the mission! Fuck the mission, Lune. What are we gonna do, huh? Tell me. What are we gonna do? We’re gonna take down the Paintress, just the three of us? My… my gun and… and your sparks?","0.0","0.8","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.2","0.0"
