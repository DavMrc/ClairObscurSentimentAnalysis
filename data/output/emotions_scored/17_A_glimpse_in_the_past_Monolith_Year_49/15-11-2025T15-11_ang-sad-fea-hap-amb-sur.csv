Our little shadow is awake. Our parents are quite the stubborn pair. They’re still fighting each other inside the Canvas. He has her imprisoned at the top of her Monolith and she has him trapped beneath. It’s a stalemate.","0.5","0.2","0.0","0.3","0.0","0.0","0.0"

"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","14","Clea","I already have. Aline is more skilled than Renoir, but I’ve tipped the scales in his favour.

"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","16","Clea","Yes, it’s enough. It’s just a matter of time. As she weakens, Renoir is able to erase her oldest creations. With the exception of her obscene fake family. She’s made them immortal, but luckily, they’re also quite useless. I need you to take care of yourself while I’m gone.","0.5","0.0","0.0","0.3","0.0","0.2","0.0"

"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","20","Clea","You will do nothing. You’re too weak to do anything useful, you’d be a liability. The Writers used you against us once before, they won’t hesitate to use you again. And I can’t promise that I’ll make the same choice Verso made. Verso traded his life for yours. I both love and hate him for that. The damn fool. Although… If you really want to be useful, then enter the Canvas and help Renoir. I need him back here sooner rather than later. I’ll fight this war alone if I have to, but I’d really rather not. Can you handle that?","0.2","0.0","0.0","0.4","0.0","0.4","0.0"

"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","2","1","Clea","Well-reasoned. And such a… clever hiding spot you’ve chosen. She’ll still find it, but… I’m impressed. This only truly ends if you destroy the Canvas. And that means stopping the final sliver of Verso’s soul from painting. See, that wasn’t so hard. Wait- that’s Aline’s chroma. Stay calm, don’t let it take control of you. Calm, Alicia, or it’ll paint over you- What an auspicious start. Well. You’re about to be reborn in this world as one of Aline’s creations. Have fun.

You’ll never know us… but I want you to know that you are loved. I want you to know… you’re not alone. You will always be the beautiful child I held in my arms. You will smile the brightest smile. You will cry iridescent tears. You will know love and you will know pain. You will know loss all too well. Because we live in an unforgiving world. But you are strong and you will survive. You will struggle… And you will learn. You’ll find people to call your own. And you’ll shine as their guiding light. For you will change the world and the people around you. You’ll forever be our princess. I have decided on her name. And her name will be… Maelle.","0.0","0.6","0.4","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0"
