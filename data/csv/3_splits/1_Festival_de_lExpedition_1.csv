"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","0","Antoine","Gustave, just the man I wanted to see."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","1","Gustave","You want a rematch, don’t you?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","2","Antoine","It’s my last chance, isn’t it?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","3","Gustave","After tomorrow, you’ll be the undisputed expert on Expedition history."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","4","Antoine","That’s tomorrow. What about today?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","5","Gustave","Who am I to deny you. Fire away."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","6","Antoine","How many years ago was the Fracture?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","7","Gustave","You’re kidding, this is your question?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","8","Antoine","Yes. When did our world break apart and our luminous city get thrown into the middle of the ocean? When was the Fracture?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","9","Gustave","67 years ago."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","10","Antoine","Brilliant. I concede. You are the undisputed expert on Lumieran History."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","11","Gustave","What are you talking about? Every child knows this. The Monolith’s essentially a reverse calendar, counting down since the Fracture happened in Year 100."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","12","Antoine","All right, fine, another one then. Which was the first expedition to depart for the continent?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","13","Gustave","Expedition Zero."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","14","Antoine","Correct. That still annoys me. They left in Year 100. They should be called Expedition 100. Makes no sense. Lumière will be long gone before the Monolith hits zero. Alright, last one. Get it right and maybe I’ll give you a token. What is a “Lumina?”"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","15","Gustave","Abilities you internalise by using a Pictos in battle after enough times."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","16","Antoine","Well done, well done."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","17","Gustave","Not really, I mean, I created the Lumina Converter… So…?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","18","Antoine","Ahem. I hereby officially end our feud. With your departure, Lumière loses a brilliant light. And a… good friend."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","19","Gustave","You big softie."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","20","Antoine","Alright, alright, here’s a token, go spend it on something."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","0","Colette","Hello there, Gustave. Perhaps one of these artefacts may prove useful to your mission?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","1","Gustave","Colette, you’ve been holding out on us. What are these?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","2","Colette","Relics from before the Fracture, passed down through the generations. The Council deemed them trinkets, but I think otherwise."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","3","Gustave","That’s kind of you to share."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","4","Colette","I may not be able to join the Expedition, but I’d still like to help. One token is all I ask."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","5","Gustave","Ah. I should’ve known."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","0","Gustave","These are yours?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","1","Sciel","You gonna lecture ME on drinking?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","2","Gustave","I wouldn’t dare. Just calculating how much it’ll hurt to catch up."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","3","Sciel","You can start now. Here, let’s have a toast. To Sophie. Who was always… unapologetically Sophie. My fierce and loving friend."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","4","Gustave","To Soph. Seriously, though, this is gonna hurt tomorrow."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","5","Sciel","Mmmm. “Tomorrow comes” but I ain’t here yet. I’m not crossing the sea sober."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","6","Gustave","Sober’s better than deathly hungover."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","7","Sciel","No, not for that."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","8","Gustave","Ah."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","9","Sciel","Go have some drinks."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","0","Gustave","Commander."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","1","Alan","Gustave. Saw you with Sophie. You talked?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","2","Gustave","Yeah. I– Yeah. Where’s your daughter?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","3","Alan","Léona’s upset. Doesn’t want to see me."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","4","Gustave","Shit."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","5","Alan","It’s ok. She doesn’t need to understand. As long as she gets to live."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","6","Gustave","Yeah."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","7","Alan","I’m counting on you."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","8","Gustave","No pressure."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","9","Alan","Oh, no. LOTS of pressure. You and Lune and your Lumina tech. That’s our edge."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","10","Gustave","I’m– Thanks, but– That’s not– Everyone has a role. Lucien, Tristan, Catherine. And YOU. You made us into a– We have a really good team, thanks to you. That’s our edge."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","11","Alan","“Tomorrow comes,” my friend."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","12","Gustave","Doesn’t it always."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","0","Jérôme","Think there’s other survivor out there?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","1","Gustave","Doubtful. We would’ve seen signs."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","2","Jérôme","But not impossible. Maybe if they have Shield Domes. But they would’ve been overrun by Nevrons before they could be any."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","3","Gustave","We were lucky the Fracture dropped us out here. Bought us time to get our defences up."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","4","Jérôme","I dunno. People are resourceful. And Nevrons can’t be everywhere. I’m betting on human ingenuity."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","5","Gustave","I like that."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","0","Gustave","You came."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","1","Lucie","I wasn’t sure if I should."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","2","Gustave","You’ve been avoiding us. You didn’t have to."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","3","Lucie","Mm. I heard Seba filled my spot. After I left."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","4","Gustave","Yeah."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","5","Lucie","D’you think I’m a coward for staying?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","6","Gustave","Do you?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","7","Lucie","Not anymore. Not all of us can change the world. Some of us can only change ourselves."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","8","Gustave","Meaning what? Make yourself accept the unacceptable? Make believe that happiness is… this?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","9","Lucie","More like… rediscover. Happiness. One Gommage left. Maybe contentment is the highest form of happiness."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","10","Gustave","It makes me sad to hear you talk like this. The Paintress stole so many things, including your capacity to dream."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","11","Lucie","No, you misunderstand. My mind is where I can be free. She can’t touch me there. This is my final act of defiance. Just like the Expedition is yours."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","12","Gustave","If you say so."
