"15","Sirène","0","0","Lune","The architecture looks very different here."
"15","Sirène","0","1","Monoco","This kind of place never existed before the Fracture."
"15","Sirène","0","2","Sciel","It’s beautiful… Feels surreal…"
"15","Sirène","0","3","Lune","Is she the Axon?"
"15","Sirène","0","4","Monoco","Sirène. She Who Plays With Wonder."
"15","Sirène","0","5","Verso","Putain."
"15","Sirène","0","6","Maelle","Lune? What’s going on?"
"15","Sirène","0","7","Lune","I-I don’t know-"
"15","Sirène","0","8","Monoco","She’s manipulating your emotions! You have to focus. Remember why you’re here. Be careful. They call her She Who Plays with Wonder. But what she really does is play with your head."
"15","Sirène","0","9","Verso","Let’s move fast, before we all lose our minds."
"15","Sirène","1","0","Verso","Don’t look at her for too long or you’ll go insane. I’ve seen people jumping off a cliff just from looking at her…"
"15","Sirène","1","1","Lune","It is… Mesmerising."
"15","Sirène","1","2","Maelle","This dance feels familiar. Was this kind of dancing taught in Lumière?"
"15","Sirène","1","3","Sciel","I don’t think so, never seen it."
"15","Sirène","2","0","Maelle","This place is huge."
"15","Sirène","2","1","Verso","Thank Expedition 67 for destroying a lot of walls to get further. Couldn’t progress without that."
"15","Sirène","2","2","Lune","It feels like home."
"15","Sirène","3","0","Maelle","What’s THAT?"
"15","Sirène","3","1","Verso","The tisseur, it works for Sirène."
"15","Sirène","3","2","Lune","So he creates all of that for her."
"15","Sirène","3","3","Verso","We should take it out. It would definitely be an advantage against Sirène."
"15","Sirène","5","0","Verso","Good job, no other expedition managed that."
"15","Sirène","5","1","Maelle","No other expedition had a Lumina converter."
"15","Sirène","5","2","Lune","Yet this victory feels hollow…"
"15","Sirène","6","0","Monoco","We’re finally there."
"15","Sirène","6","1","Verso","She’s waiting at the end of this tunnel."
"15","Sirène","6","2","Lune","Then we should prepare before we head there. She’s even grander than I thought."
"15","Sirène","6","3","Verso","Lune, you’re ok, right?"
"15","Sirène","6","4","Maelle","I swear I’ve seen this dance before."
"15","Sirène","7","0","Maelle","Is it… You again? Who are-"
"15","Sirène","7","1","Verso","Maelle?"
"15","Sirène","7","2","Lune","What did you see this time?"
"15","Sirène","7","3","Maelle","I-I don’t know. A- A woman. It was- Why do I keep seeing things? Who are you?"
