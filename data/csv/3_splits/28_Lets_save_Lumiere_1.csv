"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","1","Monoco","I do love a challenge, but this is beginning to irk me."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","2","Lune","Fuck. He keeps regenerating."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","3","Sciel","Maybe we focus on the Axons first?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","4","Maelle","(gasp)"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","5","Verso","No! She can’t-"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","6","Maelle","Maman??"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","7","Renoir","Aline, you’re going to kill yourself? It’s too soon for you to return to any Canvas! Aline! Look at Alicia. She can’t be here! Aline, it’s supposed to be you and me, not you AGAINST me."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","0","Renoir","Ironic. Your mother was the one who saved me, when I lost myself in a Canvas. She—She taught me how to safely use our gift, how to soar without flying too close to the sun. We—We Painted hundreds of Canvas worlds, pushing the very boundaries of creation. And she never let me forget that every day we spend here has a price. Yet—(cough) Yet here we are now."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","1","Maelle","So trust her. If she’s doing this, then—"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","2","Renoir","I trust what she taught me. This is not a game! You think you know what’s at stake, but you don’t!"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","3","Maelle","I know precisely what’s at stake! You want control, you want to feel like you’re doing something. You couldn’t save Verso, so you want to save us. Except you’re not. Destroying the Canvas won’t help us move on, it’ll just deny us the one place that helped us feel again."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","4","Renoir","67 years. 67 years, I spent trapped within the Monolith. But I persisted. I persisted. Do you know why? Do you know why I CANNOT leave her or you behind? This is what I see every day. I cannot spend another day with living corpses. Since the fire, our family has crumbled. Aline in the Canvas. Clea fighting her solitary war. You, a living ghost. Verso’s death broke us. I want it to be fixed. I need it to be fixed—I—(cough). I cannot lose you too."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","5","Maelle","Don’t you see?? That’s how I feel about them! I can’t lose them either. I’ve lost too much. Papa, see. I’ve lost so much."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","6","Renoir","We’ve both lost so much."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","7","Maelle","Papa. I don’t want to lose you either. I’m not leaving you forever. Just a little longer."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","8","Renoir","I want to trust you, but…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","9","Maelle","You can."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","10","Renoir","I’ll keep the light on for you. I hope you find peace. Hold onto each other."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","11","Lune","Verso…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","12","Verso","I’m sorry."
