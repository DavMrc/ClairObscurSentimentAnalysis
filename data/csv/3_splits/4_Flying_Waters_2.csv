"4","Flying Waters","15","0","Gustave","Still too far…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","1","Maelle","Being out here isn’t what I expected."
"4","Flying Waters","15","2","Gustave","As expected. Hey, you okay?"
"4","Flying Waters","15","3","Maelle","Death out here’s not like death in Lumière, is it? I– uh, I thought I was used to losing people. Like of a foster child, right? But not– not like that– on the beach… that man…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","4","Gustave","Yeah… yeah, I know… Neurons, we were prepared for, but not… And now, we finally found other survivors and it’s… You know, that’s… that’s the insidious thing about the Gommage. It’s predictable. Almost gentle. It makes Lumière complacent and accepting but… The Gommage is equally violent and death… Death is just as final."
"4","Flying Waters","15","5","Maelle","I’ve been having nightmares."
"4","Flying Waters","15","6","Gustave","Yeah, me too… Look, If death approaches, I want you to run. No, no, no. Promise me. Run. Especially if we meet the man from the beach. We can’t face him. You see him, you run."
"4","Flying Waters","15","7","Maelle","Only if you do the same."
"4","Flying Waters","15","8","Gustave","Oh, I’m running as soon as I see a strand of white hair. Trust me. You won’t even see me, I’m running so fast."
"4","Flying Waters","15","9","Maelle","Oh, please. You’re an old man, I can outrun you any day…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","10","Gustave","Yeah, right… There was a time when thirsty was young, you know…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","11","Maelle","Huh, sure…"
"4","Flying Waters","16","0","Maelle","Surprised to find you here."
"4","Flying Waters","16","1","Lune","I hope we can trust him."
"4","Flying Waters","16","2","Maelle","Well, at least, we can upgrade our Pictos."
"4","Flying Waters","22","0","Gustave","Been a long time since I’ve seen you play."
"4","Flying Waters","22","1","Lune","A Gestral village–"
"4","Flying Waters","22","2","Gustave","Yeah. I still can’t believe they exist. I mean, what other fairy tales are real?"
"4","Flying Waters","22","3","Lune","This is ultimately a war of information. But there’s still too much we don’t understand. Where the Paintress comes from? Why she does what she does? Who is she?? Seventy years and we still barely know anything."
"4","Flying Waters","22","4","Gustave","And the man on the beach. Yeah, too many unknowns. But, if we take down the Paintress, at least that gives future generations a chance to unravel the mystery."
"4","Flying Waters","22","5","Lune","You seem better than– before."
"4","Flying Waters","22","6","Gustave","Yeah? I’m holding it together?"
"4","Flying Waters","22","7","Lune","Mm."
"4","Flying Waters","22","8","Gustave","Shock’s worn off. A bit. We can’t bring anyone back. But I thought we can keep their spirit alive by pushing forward. And at least, there’s three of us now. The mission hasn’t changed."
"4","Flying Waters","22","9","Lune","Tomorrow comes."
"4","Flying Waters","22","10","Gustave","Tomorrow comes."
"4","Flying Waters","23","0","Lune","Did Noco tell you anything about the village, other than “red trees everywhere?”"
"4","Flying Waters","23","1","Maelle","Noco’s not great with specifics."
"4","Flying Waters","23","2","Gustave","We’ll just have to think like Gestrals then."
