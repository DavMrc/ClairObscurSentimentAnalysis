"0","The Gommage","4","0","Tiffanie","Oh, hi, Sophie. So Gustave really did come, huh?"
"0","The Gommage","4","1","Sophie","Hm, yeah, he did."
"0","The Gommage","4","2","Tiffanie","I knew he would."
"0","The Gommage","4","7","Sophie","Looks like you still have a lot of flowers left."
"0","The Gommage","4","8","Tiffanie","Well, there are less and less people to buy them… I just wish you didn’t have to wear one."
"0","The Gommage","4","9","Sophie","Tiffanie…"
"0","The Gommage","4","10","Tiffanie","I should finish cleaning up here and join everyone at the harbour. See you."
"0","The Gommage","4","11","Sophie","See you…"
"0","The Gommage","5","0","Gustave","I can’t imagine what you’re going through…"
"0","The Gommage","5","1","Sophie","I’m fine."
"0","The Gommage","5","2","Gustave","(sceptical grunt)"
"0","The Gommage","5","3","Sophie","I’m FINE. I’ve lived 33 good years. Look around. We’ve had our whole lives to prepare. We’re all fine. Mostly."
"0","The Gommage","5","4","Gustave","I’m not fine."
"0","The Gommage","5","5","Sophie","You will be."
"0","The Gommage","8","0","Cyril","Ah, the scintillating Sophie! You’re as gorgeous as always!"
"0","The Gommage","8","1","Sophie","Cyril, you flatterer. Need some help with your writing again?"
"0","The Gommage","8","2","Cyril","Beautiful and perceptive, per usual. See, I’m preparing the headline for tomorrow, and who could write it better than someone who celebrates her special day today!"
"0","The Gommage","8","3","Sophie","Hm, true. So, what will the article be about?"
"0","The Gommage","8","4","Cyril","Actually…"
"0","The Gommage","8","5","Sophie","You don’t know?"
"0","The Gommage","8","6","Cyril","Well…"
"0","The Gommage","8","7","Sophie","You really are lazy."
"0","The Gommage","8","8","Cyril","Help me again, Sophie, please. My boss will kill me…"
"0","The Gommage","8","9","Sophie","Sure, let me think of a headline…"
"0","The Gommage","8","10","Sophie","Expedition 33 shall be the destined journey."
"0","The Gommage","8","11","Cyril","A headline about the Expedition… That’s bold. Nobody really cares about them anymore after their constant failures. But that would make a wonderful underdog story. Okay, now I’m inspired. You really are a divine being, Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","8","12","Sophie","Don’t forget to credit me."
"0","The Gommage","8","13","Cyril","I would never… Thank you for all these times."
"0","The Gommage","8","14","Sophie","It’s always been a pleasure, my friend. Take care of yourself."
"0","The Gommage","8","15","Cyril","Yeah…"
"0","The Gommage","9","0","Estelle","Hey, you. You seem like a woman with exquisite taste. I just finished my sculpture to the legendary Esquie. This may be my life’s finest work, yet not a single soul seems to care. How could I make it better?"
"0","The Gommage","9","1","Sophie","Perhaps you could paint it? Add some colours?"
"0","The Gommage","9","2","Estelle","Paint it? Hmm… Brilliant. I knew you were the right person to ask. Thank you for your insight!"
"0","The Gommage","9","3","Sophie","You’re most welcome."
"0","The Gommage","9","4","Estelle","I shall get to work tomorrow. I see you’re wearing flowers. What’s your name?"
"0","The Gommage","9","5","Sophie","Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","9","6","Estelle","Sophie, as a thank you, I shall chisel your name onto the statue."
"0","The Gommage","9","7","Sophie","Oh, you don’t have to."
"0","The Gommage","9","8","Estelle","But I will."
"0","The Gommage","15","0","Ulysse","My Gestral costume is the best! Hey, madame, do you think the Gestrals really exist?"
"0","The Gommage","15","1","Sophie","Of course they do!"
"0","The Gommage","15","2","Ulysse","That’s what I think too. The others laugh, but I know they’re real. One day, I will meet one. Even if it means joining an Expedition! I’ll raise a Gestral army and we’ll crush the Paintress! And me and my little brother will live with the Gestrals and they’ll be our new family. We’re tired of the orphanage… If the legends are true, they really like to fight. That’s why I’m training everyday by beating up my little brother!"
"0","The Gommage","15","3","Sophie","That’s… Yeah. You would make a great Gestral."
"0","The Gommage","15","4","Ulysse","Thanks!"
"0","The Gommage","16","0","Richard","Oh, Sophie, what a lovely smell."
"0","The Gommage","16","1","Sophie","Thank you, Richard."
"0","The Gommage","16","2","Richard","I could recognize it from miles away. It’s good you’re here, Sophie. I have a favor to ask of you."
"0","The Gommage","16","3","Sophie","Anything for my beloved sewing teacher."
"0","The Gommage","16","4","Richard","I… We are of the same cohort. Today is my Gommage. And… My son and I had a fight last night. He said he wants to join the Expedition… He wants to waste the last years of his life. I… I didn’t want that for him. I used to think it was a bad choice, but today, I no longer do. I know I made a mistake. I tried to impose my views on him when he is much braver than I will ever be. So I sewed a special uniforme for him as my last gift. Could you bring it to him?"
"0","The Gommage","16","5","Sophie","Of course. I’ll bring it to Jules."
"0","The Gommage","16","6","Richard","He won’t join the Gommage ceremony, but he will be at the Expedition Festival tonight for sure. Oh, but you…"
"0","The Gommage","16","7","Sophie","Don’t worry, I’ll ask Gustave."
"0","The Gommage","16","8","Richard","Gustave? Are you back together?"
"0","The Gommage","16","9","Sophie","For this moment… Maybe."
"0","The Gommage","16","10","Richard","I’m glad… He is a good person."
"0","The Gommage","16","11","Sophie","Yes, he is…"
"0","The Gommage","16","12","Richard","Thanks to both of you. And see you."
"0","The Gommage","16","13","Sophie","See you."
