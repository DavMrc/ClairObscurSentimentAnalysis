"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","2","1","Clea","Well-reasoned. And such a… clever hiding spot you’ve chosen. She’ll still find it, but… I’m impressed. This only truly ends if you destroy the Canvas. And that means stopping the final sliver of Verso’s soul from painting. See, that wasn’t so hard. Wait- that’s Aline’s chroma. Stay calm, don’t let it take control of you. Calm, Alicia, or it’ll paint over you- What an auspicious start. Well. You’re about to be reborn in this world as one of Aline’s creations. Have fun. At least this will keep you out of trouble until I get back."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","3","0","Man from Lumière","Oh, she’s a girl… She’s a girl! She’s beautiful. What… What a lovely voice. My love, did you decide on a name?"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","3","1","Woman from Lumière","Yes. Oh, my darling girl. We have precious little time together. You’ll never know us… but I want you to know that you are loved. I want you to know… you’re not alone. You will always be the beautiful child I held in my arms. You will smile the brightest smile. You will cry iridescent tears. You will know love and you will know pain. You will know loss all too well. Because we live in an unforgiving world. But you are strong and you will survive. You will struggle… And you will learn. You’ll find people to call your own. And you’ll shine as their guiding light. For you will change the world and the people around you. You’ll forever be our princess. I have decided on her name. And her name will be… Maelle."
