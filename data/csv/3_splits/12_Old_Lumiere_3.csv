"12","Old Lumière","12","0","Lune","Excuse me. Is it true? Can you make a weapon that can pierce the barrier? Do you need something from the Axons?"
"12","Old Lumière","12","1","The Curator","(gibberish) Axons. Axons."
"12","Old Lumière","12","2","Lune","Do you need… their hearts?"
"12","Old Lumière","12","3","Verso","Look. To create this weapon, he needs enormous amounts of pure chroma. Which is way beyond what we can get from Nevrons. The only source are Axons, but like I said, that’s a dead end, it’s impossible."
"12","Old Lumière","12","4","Maelle","What? What are Axons?"
"12","Old Lumière","12","5","Verso","They’re massive creatures living on islands around the Monolith. They’re much stronger and MUCH, MUCH more dangerous than Nevrons. I can’t die and I still couldn’t take them down."
"12","Old Lumière","12","6","Lune","Yet we found the corpse of one in Old Lumière. So it’s possible."
"12","Old Lumière","12","7","Verso","I don’t know how that one die, but I’m telling you, listen to me, please, our chances of taking them down without you lot dying are close to zero."
"12","Old Lumière","12","8","Lune","Close, but not zero. Death is coming either way. And as Expeditioners, if we die, we die fighting."
"12","Old Lumière","12","9","Monoco","Wonderful pep talk."
"12","Old Lumière","12","10","Lune","I know."
"12","Old Lumière","13","0","Verso","Alright, if – IF – we’re going to fight the Axons, then let’s be smart about it."
"12","Old Lumière","13","1","Sciel","What d’you mean?"
"12","Old Lumière","13","2","Verso","I’ve had a few rough encounters with the Axons. There are three located on islands around the Monolith. and we need at least two hearts to get enough chroma. One lives on a mountain, too high for us to reach, so that one’s out. We should start with the one to the west of the Monolith. It’s already been weakened by previous Expeditions, alright?"
"12","Old Lumière","13","3","Lune","Yeah, good idea. Maximise our chances."
"12","Old Lumière","13","4","Sciel","Or we embrace the challenge and pick the one in the east!"
"12","Old Lumière","13","5","Monoco","Mmmmm, I like your spirit."
"12","Old Lumière","13","6","Sciel","Thank you."
"12","Old Lumière","13","7","Verso","Did you listen to what I just said?"
"12","Old Lumière","16","0","Verso","Lune…"
"12","Old Lumière","16","1","Lune","Mm."
"12","Old Lumière","16","2","Verso","Okay, we’ll talk later then."
"12","Old Lumière","18","0","Esquie","I’m mad."
"12","Old Lumière","18","1","Verso","Esquie?"
"12","Old Lumière","18","2","Esquie","I’m stinking mad."
"12","Old Lumière","18","3","Verso","About Noco?"
"12","Old Lumière","18","4","Esquie","That was MEAN. I thought he cared! Renoir’s not being Renoir!"
"12","Old Lumière","18","5","Verso","He’s not- (exhale) I know, buddy. I’m mad too."
"12","Old Lumière","20","0","Maelle","So the masked person with Renoir, that’s your sister?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","1","Verso","…"
"12","Old Lumière","20","2","Maelle","Not a hard leap to make."
"12","Old Lumière","20","3","Verso","Her name’s Alicia."
"12","Old Lumière","20","4","Maelle","What’s wrong with her? She wears a mask all the time, she never talks, and she’s always staring."
"12","Old Lumière","20","5","Verso","She, uh- She was trapped in a fire. A long time ago. Damaged her face and her throat, so, up- Yeah."
"12","Old Lumière","20","6","Maelle","Huh. Why… did they come to see me?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","7","Verso","I don’t know. That surprised me, when you told me. She helped me before, I thought she’d help me again. But it seems she’s chosen a different side. “Family is complicated,” right?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","8","Maelle","Mm. Yeah."
"12","Old Lumière","20","9","Verso","Do you want the armband back?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","10","Maelle","What?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","11","Verso","I feel like a fraud, wearing it. Given, you know…"
"12","Old Lumière","20","12","Maelle","Wear it anyway. You said you chose your side, right?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","13","Verso","I did. You’re not upset with me?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","14","Maelle","Strangely, no. I hate secrets, but… Gustave always gave people the benefit of the doubt. And your actions are what matters. I trust you."
"12","Old Lumière","20","15","Verso","Thanks."
