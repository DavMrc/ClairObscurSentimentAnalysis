"6","Gestral Village","3","0","Lune","It’s… it’s really a village of Gestrals!"
"6","Gestral Village","3","1","Gustave","They seem better at surviving than humans."
"6","Gestral Village","3","2","Maelle","I guess intelligence is not a prerequisite for survival on the continent. Now to find the chief’s house. Probably the biggest one."
"6","Gestral Village","4","1","Golgra","(gibberish) So YOU’RE the warriors who demolished our ULTIMATE Sakapatate?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","2","Maelle","It wasn’t that strong."
"6","Gestral Village","4","3","Golgra","(gibberish) Hmmmm. I see. Well. You’ve earned my respect. What can I do for you?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","4","Lune","Are you the “Chef?”"
"6","Gestral Village","4","5","Golgra","(gibberish) I am indeed the “Chef” of our village. The name’s Golgra."
"6","Gestral Village","4","6","Lune","There are so many questions I’d love to ask–"
"6","Gestral Village","4","7","Gustave","We need to get to the Paintress. Noco said you could help us cross the sea?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","8","Golgra","(gibberish) Humans. Still so obsessed with the Paintress."
"6","Gestral Village","4","9","Lune","Others have passed through here?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","10","Golgra","(gibberish) A few of your expeditions, every few years. Hard to keep track. Hmmm. Do you not have your own boat? How did you get here in the first place?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","11","Lune","A white-haired man destroyed it."
"6","Gestral Village","4","12","Golgra","(gibberish) And you survived? My respect."
"6","Gestral Village","4","13","Lune","You know him?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","14","Golgra","(gibberish) He attacked the village once. Some of us survived. Somehow. Mmm. Ok. You have no boat. In that case, your best bet is Esquie. If you ask nicely, maybe Esquie can take you across the water."
"6","Gestral Village","4","15","Lune","So Esquie exists!"
"6","Gestral Village","4","16","Golgra","(gibberish) Of course! Esquie lives not far from here. But only the greatest warriors are allowed through. You need a password."
"6","Gestral Village","4","17","Maelle","Why?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","18","Golgra","(gibberish) Esquie is very friendly, but Esquie could also accidentally eat you. Esquie doesn’t know its own strength sometimes. It would be irresponsible to let weaklings visit Esquie."
"6","Gestral Village","4","19","Maelle","We already defeated your Ultimate Sakapatate."
"6","Gestral Village","4","20","Golgra","(gibberish) Not. Good. Enough. You’ll have to enter our Legendary Tournament to get the password. This is the Gestral way. You will be fighting our Legendary Warriors. They are old so it should be easy."
"6","Gestral Village","4","22","Golgra","(gibberish) Now I’m excited. Let’s see what you can do. Oh, and you’ll also fight the Stranger. Yeah, that will be fun."
"6","Gestral Village","4","23","Lune","The Stranger?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","24","Golgra","(gibberish) Okay, enough talk. Go fight now. Do you want to go to the arena directly or do you want to beat up a few gestrals around here first?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","1","Maelle","Wait– That’s–"
"6","Gestral Village","49","2","Gustave","Sciel?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","3","Sciel","What– How– You guys– You’re alive! I thought I was the only one left– I knew you were resourceful."
"6","Gestral Village","49","4","Lune","How did you get here?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","5","Gestral announcer","(gibberish) Hey, humans! We’re here to see some fighting! If you don’t wanna fight, we’ll come down and fight ourselves!"
"6","Gestral Village","49","6","Sciel","They’re expecting a bit of a show. Shall we?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","0","Maelle","Well, that wasn’t so bad."
"6","Gestral Village","50","1","Gustave","Yeah, really just felt like beating old people."
"6","Gestral Village","50","2","Maelle","So it wasn’t so bad."
"6","Gestral Village","50","3","Sciel","Am I one of those old people?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","4","Gustave","One day, I hope. Hey, how’d you end up here?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","5","Sciel","Oh, um. After the beach– I ended up in an odd yellow forest, not too far from here. Had to dodge a few Nevrons. But luckily, I met a Gestral who guided me here. What about you?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","6","Gustave","Um… Well, I– I woke up near to a waterfall and–"
"6","Gestral Village","50","7","Lune","We can talk later. Let’s go back to Golgra."
"6","Gestral Village","50","8","Gustave","No time to lose."
