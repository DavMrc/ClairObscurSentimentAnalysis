"6","Gestral Village","51","2","Sciel","Very gestral-ish."
"6","Gestral Village","51","3","Golgra","(gibberish) Esquie’s Nest is east of the Village. Sunniso guards the path. Shout the password as loud as you can and Sunniso will let you through."
"6","Gestral Village","51","4","Sciel","“As loud as we can.” Got it."

"6","Gestral Village","51","9","Sciel","Thanks, Chief."
"6","Gestral Village","52","0","Sciel","I still can’t believe it. I lost hope after a while, but you all survived."
"6","Gestral Village","52","1","Gustave","What was your plan if we hadn’t? Be a gestral champion until your Gommage?"
"6","Gestral Village","52","2","Sciel","Well, it was a lot of fun so, yeah, maybe?"
"6","Gestral Village","53","0","Lune","Noco’s quite obsessed with your arm. Your apprentices will be extremely proud knowing a Gestral loves their work."
"6","Gestral Village","53","1","Gustave","Yeah, they’d be insanely excited."
"6","Gestral Village","53","2","Lune","Well, they did a great job designing your arm. It was quite a creative assignement you gave them."
"6","Gestral Village","53","3","Gustave","Well, when life gives you lemons…"
"6","Gestral Village","53","4","Lune","Losing an arm is quite a lemon."
"6","Gestral Village","53","5","Gustave","Yeah, it’s not limonade."
"6","Gestral Village","53","6","Lune","(laughs)"
"6","Gestral Village","55","0","Gustave","You okay? You’ve been quiet since we left the Village."
"6","Gestral Village","55","1","Sciel","Yeah. Sorry… Bad memories."
"6","Gestral Village","55","2","Gustave","Wanna talk about it?"
"6","Gestral Village","55","3","Sciel","Hm, no."
"6","Gestral Village","55","4","Gustave","Hm, nah…"
"6","Gestral Village","55","5","Sciel","I’m glad you’re here."
"6","Gestral Village","55","6","Gustave","I would never abandon a member of Aquafarm 3."
"6","Gestral Village","55","7","Sciel","Aquafarm 3. That was so long ago. You and Sophie were inseparable on that project."
"6","Gestral Village","55","8","Gustave","Yeah, we were."
"6","Gestral Village","55","9","Sciel","It was a good project. It fed so many neighbourhoods at once. Kinda nostalgic, thinking back. We really thought we were making a difference."
"6","Gestral Village","55","10","Gustave","Hey, we’re still making a différence."
"6","Gestral Village","55","11","Sciel","Yes. Of course!"
"6","Gestral Village","55","12","Gustave","Yeah…"
"6","Gestral Village","58","0","Sciel","I can’t believe it. We’re gonna meet THE Esquie."
"6","Gestral Village","58","1","Lune","The Gestrals. And Esquie. The tales are true."
"6","Gestral Village","58","2","Maelle","Do you feel someth– White hair… Who are you?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","3","White-haired man","Alicia. I told you to stay home. It’s not good for you to see this. Yes. Yes, I understand. It’s her fault and she doesn’t even know it. But you can’t be here."
"6","Gestral Village","58","4","Maelle","What are you talking about? What’s my fault?! What is this?!"
"6","Gestral Village","58","5","White-haired man","You should never have come. You’re only going to make things worse. For everyone. Now take your friends and go home. Let them spend their final year in peace. This is your only warning."
"6","Gestral Village","58","6","Sciel","I can’t wait to see–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","7","Gustave","Maelle? Hey, hey, hey…"
"6","Gestral Village","58","8","Maelle","It was him! It was him! The white-haired man– and this woman–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","9","Gustave","Wai– Where– What are you talking about?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","10","Lune","Maelle, breathe. Slow down. What did you see? Think carefully. Every detail could be important."
"6","Gestral Village","58","11","Maelle","He said– He said we need to go… home. And that it’s– It’s my fault? That I’m– I’m gonna make things… worse. For everyone. You were all– frozen. I couldn’t– I couldn’t– It was like– a waking nightmare."
"6","Gestral Village","58","12","Gustave","It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s over."
"6","Gestral Village","58","13","Lune","What else? You said there was a woman?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","14","Sciel","Lune, maybe later."
"6","Gestral Village","58","15","Maelle","She– She had a mask– And–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","16","Lune","I know this is hard, but I need you to focus, okay? While the details are fresh."
"6","Gestral Village","58","17","Gustave","Lune. Ask her tomorrow. Hey, hey. Breathe. Silent to me. You’re safe. Do you understand? Okay? It’s over."
"6","Gestral Village","59","0","Gustave","Feeling better?"
"6","Gestral Village","59","1","Maelle","Yeah–"
"6","Gestral Village","59","2","Lune","We can debrief along the way. Let’s head east to Esquie’s Nest."
