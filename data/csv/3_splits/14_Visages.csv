"14","Visages","0","0","Lune","So this is Visages’ island…"
"14","Visages","0","1","Monoco","He Who Guards Truth With Lies."
"14","Visages","0","2","Sciel","Are those… Faces?"
"14","Visages","0","3","Monoco","An infinite sea of them."
"14","Visages","0","4","Sciel","Is this island… singing?"
"14","Visages","0","5","Maelle","This melody…"
"14","Visages","0","6","Lune","This is creeping me out."
"14","Visages","1","0","Sciel","What’s it doing?"
"14","Visages","1","1","Verso","It’s not attacking…"
"14","Visages","1","2","Maelle","Was that an invitation?"
"14","Visages","1","3","Sciel","So it seems?"
"14","Visages","1","4","Verso","Mm-mm. Feels like a trap."
"14","Visages","1","5","Maelle","I don’t mind a straightforward path for once. Better than battling through a mountain of Nevrons."
"14","Visages","1","6","Sciel","No, Verso’s right. Something feels off."
"14","Visages","1","7","Mark Keeper","Oh, I’m harmless, you don’t need those."
"14","Visages","1","8","Verso","Well, if you’re harmless, then these weapons will stay harmless too."
"14","Visages","1","9","Mark Keeper","Touché. Well. Visages invites you to join him in his chamber at the end of this path. I assume that’s why you’re here?"
"14","Visages","1","10","Sciel","Where do the other paths lead?"
"14","Visages","1","11","Mark Keeper","You’re free to traverse them. Masks are not just to obscure. They may also illuminate. Look for the masks that you need."
"14","Visages","1","12","Maelle","Meaning?"
"14","Visages","1","13","Mark Keeper","The invitation stands."
"14","Visages","1","14","Sciel","Well. Head straight to the Axon or take the other paths?"
"14","Visages","5","0","Maelle","Did you hear that?"
"14","Visages","5","1","Verso","That was the Axon."
"14","Visages","5","2","Sciel","Destroying these masks seems to hurt him."
"14","Visages","5","3","Lune","Then let’s keep doing that."
"14","Visages","6","0","Sciel","I know they’re Nevrons, but… witnessing the sorrow of others… I can’t help but feel for them."
"14","Visages","6","1","Monoco","A noble but tremendously fatal impulse."
"14","Visages","10","0","Maelle","Yeah, it definitely hurts him. I think I saw one more path."
"14","Visages","10","1","Verso","That’s good, we’re weakening him."
"14","Visages","10","2","Sciel","This feels… off…"
"14","Visages","11","0","Lune","Everything’s destroyed."
"14","Visages","11","1","Monoco","Normally I enjoy a little destruction, but this doesn’t feel right."
"14","Visages","11","2","Sciel","It’s rage."
"14","Visages","16","0","Lune","Monoco, what does that mean, “He Who Guards Truth With Lies?”"
"14","Visages","16","1","Monoco","Exactly what it sounds like."
"14","Visages","16","2","Sciel","Guard as in protect? Or guard as in control?"
"14","Visages","16","3","Monoco","Yes."
"14","Visages","17","0","Verso","I think you pissed him off."
"14","Visages","17","1","Mask Keeper","People want so badly to know, “What’s behind the mask?” Front, back. Recto, verso. Great art is both window and mirror. Whether it’s your mask or theirs."
"14","Visages","17","2","Verso","Harmless, huh."
"14","Visages","17","3","Sciel","He’s the real Axon."
"14","Visages","17","4","Mask Keeper","Child, we all need masks, but how you use them, mmm."
"14","Visages","17","5","Maelle","Merde."
"14","Visages","18","0","Maelle","We did it!"
"14","Visages","18","1","Sciel","No, wait-"
"14","Visages","18","2","Mask Keeper","We all need masks-"
"14","Visages","18","3","Sciel","This mask can’t hurt me. Because it is me."
"14","Visages","18","4","Verso","You okay? What happened?"
"14","Visages","18","5","Sciel","Axon down. Let’s bring this to the Curator."
"14","Visages","18","6","Verso","That was Verso, wasn’t it? Renoir?"
"14","Visages","19","0","Maelle","Me? You want me to give it to you?"
"14","Visages","19","1","Lune","Why?"
"14","Visages","19","2","Maelle","That was- I saw-"
"14","Visages","19","3","Sciel","What happened?"
"14","Visages","19","4","Maelle","I saw- I saw… It was… Renoir?"
"14","Visages","19","5","Verso","I used to see him in my nightmares too. He can be quite traumatising."
