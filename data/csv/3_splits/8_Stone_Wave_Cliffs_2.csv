"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","0","Sciel","Last time we sat together like this…"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","1","Lune","Mm. In Lumière. Mourning our parents."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","2","Sciel","Seems like everytime we’re together, it’s to grieve. I wish we could have spent more time… in less hopeless contexts."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","3","Lune","The plan doesn’t change. We aim for the Monolith. We keep heading north. With Esquie’s help, we can make it. But we lost the Lumina Converter–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","4","Sciel","It’s ok, we can think about that later–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","5","Lune","All the backups were destroyed by that MAN, but Expedition 32 will bring more, their chances will be better– We need to prepare them. I should update our journals–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","6","Sciel","Hey, hey, hey. It’s ok. Tomorrow will still come."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","7","Lune","Sciel–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","8","Stranger","This seemed important. If you want to reach the Monolith, the best path is through the quarry up north."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","9","Lune","Who are you?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","10","Sciel","And where did you get that expedition uniform?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","11","Stranger","Strange way to say thank you. Um. I’m sorry I couldn’t save your friend. I’m wearing an expedition uniform because I, too, am an Expeditioner–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","12","Sciel","What? What d’you mean, you’re an–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","13","Lune","I’ve never seen you before–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","14","Stranger","First Expedition. Expedition Zero."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","15","Lune","Expedition Zero? But how are you alive? And not–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","16","Stranger","Old? I don’t know, exactly, but some of us stopped aging. And we’re not affected by the Gommage."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","17","Lune","“Some” of you. Like the man on the cliff."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","18","Stranger","Renoir. Our commander."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","19","Lune","Why? Why did he massacre our team?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","20","Sciel","How could he turn on his own people?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","21","Stranger","He believes his immortality is a gift from the Paintress. Killing her would kill him too. And he enjoys living forever."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","22","Lune","And you don’t?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","23","Stranger","Burying everyone you know while you live on… Can wear you down a bit. I couldn’t help your friend, but perhaps, I can help you."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","24","Lune","You want to join us?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","25","Stranger","If you don’t mind the company… Yes."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","26","Maelle","So if I want to kill Renoir, I have to kill the Paintress first. What’s your name?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","27","Stranger","Verso."
