"3","Spring Meadows","0","0","Lune","You do that, we both die. Hey. Fucking hell. Wake up, Gustave."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","1","Gustave","Lune– The others–"
"3","Spring Meadows","0","2","Lune","I know. We’re the only ones left. You don’t get to die."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","3","Gustave","It’s just a matter of time, before we– “We’re already dead.” Look around– Look– Look–"
"3","Spring Meadows","0","4","Lune","This is not a foregone conclusion. “When one falls, we continue.” GET UP. We need to find a safer place, there are Nevrons around."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","5","Gustave","Lucien– I couldn’t–"
"3","Spring Meadows","0","6","Lune","This is not the place… The Lumina Converter seems intact. It’s about time we test it in real conditions."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","7","Gustave","Putain… Putain…"
"3","Spring Meadows","1","0","Lune","We did it, Gustave. Let’s see if your invention lives up to its reputation, shall we? It really works. We’re not dead yet."
"3","Spring Meadows","1","1","Gustave","Yeah."
"3","Spring Meadows","1","2","Lune","Come on. There might be other survivors at the Indigo Tree."
"3","Spring Meadows","4","0","Lune","Someone came here before and set up these handholds."
"3","Spring Meadows","4","1","Gustave","Probably Expedition 69, the climbers expedition."
"3","Spring Meadows","4","2","Lune","Let us thank them for that."
"3","Spring Meadows","5","0","Jar","(gibberish) (weepy mumble)"
"3","Spring Meadows","5","1","Lune","Something’s wrong with it. Why isn’t it attacking us?"
"3","Spring Meadows","5","2","Gustave","Well, it certainly attacked them. An expedition journal… 81. “Learn from the ones who came before…”"
"3","Spring Meadows","5","3","Lune","“… And lay the trail, for the ones who come after.”"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","0","Lune","They communicate with a Nevron?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","1","Gustave","The dead here don’t disappear, like in Lumière. Their chroma stays inside their bodies."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","2","Lune","On the beach… some did disappear."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","3","Gustave","He wasn’t a Nevron."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","4","Lune","Something about the way Nevrons kill seems to affect our chroma…"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","5","Gustave","Perhaps your friend here can enlighten us."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","6","Jar","(gibberish) Enlighten… Light… I need light…"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","7","Gustave","It really does speak."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","8","Lune","What do you mean, light?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","9","Gustave","Did you kill these people?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","10","Jar","(gibberish) I would never plunge others into darkness. I was painted to bring light."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","11","Lune","Painted? By the Paintress?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","12","Jar","(gibberish) Paint-tress? Yes. She painted me. Help me… Find light."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","13","Lune","If we bring it light, perhaps we can learn more…"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","14","Gustave","I’m not sure that’s a good idea…"
"3","Spring Meadows","7","0","Lune","Flares!"
"3","Spring Meadows","7","1","Gustave","Survivors!"
"3","Spring Meadows","7","2","Lune","Hurry!"
