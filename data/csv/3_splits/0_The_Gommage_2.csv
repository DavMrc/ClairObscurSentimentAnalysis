"0","The Gommage","17","0","Eloise","Hm…"
"0","The Gommage","17","1","Sophie","Is something wrong?"
"0","The Gommage","17","2","Eloise","The Expeditions… What a joke."
"0","The Gommage","17","3","Sophie","…"
"0","The Gommage","17","4","Eloise","All they do is leave us here to die. They’re just escaping."
"0","The Gommage","17","5","Sophie","You know their goal is to save us all, right?"
"0","The Gommage","17","6","Eloise","Yeah, that’s what my father told me last year. Before he left for Expedition 34. And here we are again this year. We could have spent one more year together instead of wasting it away…"
"0","The Gommage","17","7","Sophie","Your father fought to offer you a better future…"
"0","The Gommage","17","8","Eloise","I have no future. I know it and I’ve accepted it. We’re doomed."
"0","The Gommage","17","9","Sophie","You never know, this Expedition might be different. There are some special people in this one."
"0","The Gommage","17","10","Eloise","Yeah, right…"
"0","The Gommage","17","11","Sophie","Gustave? Why don’t you show her some of your fighting skills to prove her wrong?"
"0","The Gommage","17","12","Eloise","That’s… This guy is strong…"
"0","The Gommage","17","13","Sophie","They all train their Pictos skills very hard to save us all. And so did your father."
"0","The Gommage","17","14","Eloise","Then, madam, why didn’t you join?"
"0","The Gommage","17","15","Sophie","Me? I’m content with my life. I know what I can and cannot change. Or maybe… Because I was afraid."
"0","The Gommage","17","16","Eloise","… Do you think… I should join the Expedition?"
"0","The Gommage","17","17","Sophie","My friend Sciel always says, do your best, either it works or it doesn’t. Live your life as you want."
"0","The Gommage","17","18","Eloise","I… I don’t want to have regrets… I don’t have that much time…"
"0","The Gommage","17","19","Sophie","When the time comes, you’ll make the right decision. I’m sure."
"0","The Gommage","17","20","Eloise","Thank you. Now I think I know… Give this to your boyfriend, my father gave it to me, but it might be more useful for him."
"0","The Gommage","21","0","Ophélie","Hi, Gustave. You’re back. Did you want to pick out a different flower?"
"0","The Gommage","21","1","Gustave","No, the one you suggested earlier was perfect."
"0","The Gommage","21","2","Ophélie","I’m glad. These garlands are our last farewell. I want them all to feel special. I have a garland saved for you, too. But it’s not a farewell garland. It will be a welcome home garland. Good luck… My friend."
"0","The Gommage","21","3","Gustave","Thanks, Ophélie."
"0","The Gommage","22","0","Sophie","Oh, Lune’s playing. You two would make a cute couple."
"0","The Gommage","22","1","Gustave","If you say so."
"0","The Gommage","22","2","Sophie","Or maybe… Something already happened, huh?"
"0","The Gommage","22","3","Gustave","…"
"0","The Gommage","27","0","Sophie","Sometimes I feel sorry for her."
"0","The Gommage","27","1","Gustave","Who, the– The Paintress??"
"0","The Gommage","27","2","Sophie","Look at her. She looks… sad. Maybe she’s a prisoner too. Stuck in the same cycle with us. Silly, huh?"
"0","The Gommage","27","3","Gustave","Only you could choose empathy at a moment like this."
"0","The Gommage","27","4","Sophie","It’s one of the few choices I can make."
"0","The Gommage","27","5","Gustave","I couldn’t do it."
"0","The Gommage","27","6","Sophie","It’s ok. You don’t have to."
"0","The Gommage","29","0","Mielle","Oh, hi, Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","29","1","Sophie","Oh? Mielle? I didn’t expect to see you here."
"0","The Gommage","29","2","Mielle","I’m volunteering to help guide children who are losing their parents to the orphanage. Those who were not registered for foster families…"
"0","The Gommage","29","3","Sophie","How kind of you."
"0","The Gommage","29","4","Mielle","I guess I can relate…"
"0","The Gommage","29","5","Sophie","Take care during the Expedition. Gustave told me a lot of wonderful things about you."
"0","The Gommage","29","6","Mielle","About you too. I always told him you two should never have broken up."
"0","The Gommage","29","7","Sophie","Look at these orphans, that’s… That’s where we disagreed. But I have hope that you and Gustave will change things, so no one has to go through this impossible choice again."
"0","The Gommage","29","8","Mielle","Yeah… Let’s hope we will."
"0","The Gommage","29","9","Sophie","See you."
"0","The Gommage","29","10","Mielle","In the next life."
"0","The Gommage","36","0","Henri","You’d have to be crazy to use Pictos on your own body."
"0","The Gommage","36","1","Sophie","Why? Aren’t you enjoying the show?"
"0","The Gommage","36","2","Henri","Nah, the show’s great, but etching chroma onto your skin? oof, that’s brutal. And just for a dance? I’ll stick to painting Pictos on my machines, I’m not cuckoo enough to put them on my body."
"0","The Gommage","36","3","Sophie","Could be useful though, the Expeditions rely on them quite heavily."
"0","The Gommage","36","4","Henri","Eh, they’re crazy too. But at least, you can remove Pictos pretty easily if you change your mind."
"0","The Gommage","40","0","Sophie","I’ve always loved the Harbour."
"0","The Gommage","42","0","Sophie","I see your apprentices."
"0","The Gommage","42","1","Alexandre","Gustave! Gustave!"
"0","The Gommage","42","2","Gustave","What–"
"0","The Gommage","42","3","Guillaume","Here. Sophie asked us to bring you your coat."
"0","The Gommage","42","4","Alexandre","We sewed up the sleeves so you don’t have to keep rolling it up."
"0","The Gommage","42","5","Gustave","You guys know how to sew?"
"0","The Gommage","42","6","Alexandre","Sophie helped us. Turns out, it’s not that hard! You really shoulda done this ages ago."
"0","The Gommage","42","7","Gustave","You did this?"
"0","The Gommage","42","8","Sophie","Gentlemen, that was supposed to be between us, yeah? I wanted to do something. For you."
"0","The Gommage","42","9","Gustave","Soph. Thanks, guys, this is– This is great. Thank you."
"0","The Gommage","42","10","Alexandre","See you at the festival?"
"0","The Gommage","42","11","Guillaume","Don’t leave without saying goodbye."
"0","The Gommage","42","12","Gustave","Yeah, of course not. What? I know that face."
"0","The Gommage","42","13","Sophie","You mean a lot to them. I can tell."
"0","The Gommage","42","14","Gustave","Yeah, they mean a lot to me too. Legacy can take many forms, right?"
"0","The Gommage","42","15","Sophie","Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","42","16","Gustave","You taught me that."
"0","The Gommage","42","17","Sophie","Hm. Right."
"0","The Gommage","42","18","Gustave","Why?"
"0","The Gommage","42","19","Sophie","I… wanted to see you wearing it."
"0","The Gommage","42","20","Gustave","Oh, you like uniforms now?"
"0","The Gommage","42","21","Sophie","This too is your legacy."
"0","The Gommage","42","22","Gustave","In a way, it’s yours too."
"0","The Gommage","43","0","Gustave","I’m here."
"0","The Gommage","43","1","Sophie","I know. I know."
