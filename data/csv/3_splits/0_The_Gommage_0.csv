"0","The Gommage","0","0","Maelle","If you’re gonna give someone flowers, you should probably do it BEFORE they wither and die."
"0","The Gommage","0","1","Gustave","What, the flower? Or Sophie?"
"0","The Gommage","0","2","Maelle","Ooh, dark. Sophie would approve. Hey, you said it, not me. The others are waiting for you, you’re supposed to be helping with the festival."
"0","The Gommage","0","3","Gustave","With what? Putting three tables? They’ll manage."
"0","The Gommage","0","4","Maelle","Ah. You underestimate Lumière’s enthusiasm for the Expedition. There’s at least FIVE tables."
"0","The Gommage","0","5","Gustave","Marvellous."
"0","The Gommage","0","6","Maelle","Have you tried throwing with your other arm instead? If you could hit the Paintress directly, that would actually be useful."
"0","The Gommage","0","7","Gustave","You know, hobbies don’t always have to be useful. I’m enjoying the uselessness of today, and readying my usefulness for tomorrow. And soon, we’ll get to do a lot more than throw rocks."
"0","The Gommage","0","8","Maelle","That’s what all the other expeditions said too."
"0","The Gommage","0","9","Gustave","Heyheyhey. You know, you know they gave their lives to lay the trail for us, right?"
"0","The Gommage","0","10","Maelle","Yeah, I know, sorry."
"0","The Gommage","0","11","Gustave","Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","0","12","Maelle","You still got a flower to give, no?"
"0","The Gommage","0","13","Gustave","Yes, yes. It’s just… I’m not sure how to start. After four years apart, what do I say to her, on the day of her Gommage."
"0","The Gommage","0","14","Maelle","You’re asking ME? I dunno, sun’s about to set, so… be direct? “Hey Soph-been a while. Could we–”"
"0","The Gommage","1","0","Maelle","All right, let’s go. I’ll accompany you there. Are you… ready to see her again?"
"0","The Gommage","1","1","Gustave","Yeah, been ready."
"0","The Gommage","1","2","Maelle","I set up these grapple shortcuts. Nice, huh? Don’t tell your sister, though. I sort of “borrowed” the hooks from the Expedition Academy. Wish I had them when I was working as a courier… Come on, Gustave, speed up a bit. Sophie will have already gommaged by the time you’ve arrived."
"0","The Gommage","1","3","Gustave","Maelle."
"0","The Gommage","1","4","Maelle","I can’t believe Sophie already turned 33… She looks so much younger than you."
"0","The Gommage","1","5","Gustave","Thanks."
"0","The Gommage","1","6","Maelle","She’s popular, I’m sure she already has a necklace full of flowers."
"0","The Gommage","1","7","Gustave","Hm. I can imagine."
"0","The Gommage","1","8","Maelle","Hmm…"
"0","The Gommage","1","9","Gustave","What?"
"0","The Gommage","1","10","Maelle","You look tense."
"0","The Gommage","1","11","Gustave","Yeah, I, hum… Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","1","12","Maelle","I know what you need! A little duel!"
"0","The Gommage","1","13","Gustave","No."
"0","The Gommage","1","14","Maelle","Come on, it’ll loosen you up. You can’t go and see Sophie all sombre and tense."
"0","The Gommage","1","15","Gustave","Hmmm…"
"0","The Gommage","1","16","Maelle","And… if you win, I’ll give you something you can use with your Lumina Converter."
"0","The Gommage","1","17","Gustave","Alright, you’re on."
"0","The Gommage","1","18","Maelle","Yes!"
"0","The Gommage","2","0","Maelle","You won! Now, don’t you feel better? I see your smile. All right, now let’s go find Sophie. I saw her near the red and white tree."
"0","The Gommage","2","1","Gustave","Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","2","2","Maelle","Oh, the Plaza is lively. Why people like to celebrate the Gommage is still a mystery to me, but, oh, well. The red and white tree… I’ve always found it beautiful. I don’t really understand. You and Sophie broke up so long ago. But clearly, you never got over her. Why’d you wait until today to say something? It’s a bit late, isn’t it? Sophie is down there."
"0","The Gommage","2","3","Gustave","Yeah, I know."
"0","The Gommage","2","4","Maelle","I… Good luck. I’ll be here for you if things… don’t go as planned."
"0","The Gommage","2","5","Gustave","Thanks."
"0","The Gommage","3","0","Sophie","…the last few days meant everything."
"0","The Gommage","3","1","Gustave","…Could we talk?"
"0","The Gommage","3","2","Sophie","Gustave. I love you all."
"0","The Gommage","3","3","Gustave","For your, um– If there’s room…"
"0","The Gommage","3","4","Sophie","There’s always room."
"0","The Gommage","3","5","Gustave","You know, I’m sorry that…"
"0","The Gommage","3","6","Sophie","I missed you–"
"0","The Gommage","3","7","Gustave","I missed you too."
"0","The Gommage","3","8","Sophie","You don’t need to– (laugh) Okay."
"0","The Gommage","3","9","Gustave","You go."
"0","The Gommage","3","10","Sophie","No, you."
"0","The Gommage","3","11","Gustave","You, uh– You know how I fell. I– I wish things had been– You know… I often think– Another path, you know… Another future–"
"0","The Gommage","3","12","Sophie","Still can’t finish your sentences, can you?"
"0","The Gommage","3","13","Gustave","Yeah, that hasn’t changed…"
"0","The Gommage","3","14","Sophie","I missed that. I never faulted you for wanting to believe. You’re fighting. To change things. I understand, I just… In a “different world”, right?"
"0","The Gommage","3","15","Gustave","We’ll break the cycle. So She can’t steal anyone else’s future."
"0","The Gommage","3","16","Sophie","Stubborn people change the world. And you are the most stubborn person I know. Thank you. Walk me to the harbour?"
"0","The Gommage","3","17","Gustave","Yes."
