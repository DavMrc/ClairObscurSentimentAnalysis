"15","Sirène","14","0","Sciel","We’ve done it."
"15","Sirène","14","1","Maelle","We’re really going to face the Paintress."
"15","Sirène","14","2","Lune","And finally break this cycle."
"15","Sirène","14","3","Sciel","That being said… Someone here has been hiding a terrible secret from us."
"15","Sirène","14","4","Lune","What are you talking about?"
"15","Sirène","14","5","Sciel","You thought we’d never find out, didn’t you? Nobody ever wondered what Esquie was made of, did they? Well, Esquie and I had a chat."
"15","Sirène","14","6","Esquie","I’m sorry, Verso! She promised me sweet rocks!"
"15","Sirène","14","7","Lune","What! Is that wine?"
"15","Sirène","14","8","Verso","I stored my personal stash inside him. All excellent vintages. I don’t normally share, but I suppose tonight deserves an exception."
"15","Sirène","14","9","Esquie","Mon ami, I told you to stop drinking alone."
"15","Sirène","14","10","Sciel","To your great generosity."
"15","Sirène","14","11","Maelle","I don’t know how you can like this."
"15","Sirène","14","12","Lune","It comes with age."
"15","Sirène","14","13","Maelle","Do you have apple juice?"
"15","Sirène","14","14","Verso","Yeah, I’ll, uh, I’ll leave you to it."
"15","Sirène","15","0","Verso","My beautiful sister doesn’t need this ugly mask."
"15","Sirène","15","1","Renoir","You embrace her, yet you’re condemning her to die."
"15","Sirène","15","2","Verso","You brought him here?!"
"15","Sirène","15","3","Renoir","I’m not here to fight. But my son, do you know what it means to disappear into nothingness? Have you thought through the consequences? Not just for you, or even me, but for them. Their memories, their dreams, their love for each other? Who really is the one painting death? And who paints life instead? We exist and we will exist for as long as she wants. You want to spoil what we’ve been given. Sometimes, we paint the bars of our own prison. Your despair blinds you. You think you’re ready to pay the price. But are you willing to let THEM pay the price for YOU?"
"15","Sirène","15","4","Renoir/Verso","May everything be decided before their very eyes. Between the bars of their prison."
"15","Sirène","15","5","Verso","In the shadow of the Monolith."
"15","Sirène","15","6","Renoir","In the shadow of the Monolith."
