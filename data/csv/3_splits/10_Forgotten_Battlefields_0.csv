"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","0","Verso","You’ll get used to them, we’re going to see a lot more."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","1","Lune","If we hurry, we can cross before nightfall."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","2","Maelle","Wait. Could we bury Gustave?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","3","Lune","I wish we could, but protocol is to keep moving. Gustave would understand…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","4","Sciel","We can look for a suitable place. Along the way, yeah? We’ll find a nice spot."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","5","Verso","Actually. There is a place. Past the quarry, out of the sight of the Paintress. A tranquil haven protected by magnificent trees. I think you’ll approve."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","6","Lune","Lead the way."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","7","Verso","Let me show you something."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","8","Lune","Any other tricks we should know?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","9","Verso","One thing at a time."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","0","Sciel","These are all… Expeditions?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","1","Verso","A single Nevron took out most of them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","2","Lune","Is it still around?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","3","Verso","I’ve only seen him once, many years ago, so most likely not."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","0","Verso","Hey, you holding up? We’re almost there."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","1","Maelle","Holding up? Everywhere we go, just death, death and more death. Everywhere we go, just death. I just- I don’t want to see that anymore."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","2","Verso","Look, Maelle, it-"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","3","Maelle","I thought YOU would understand. You said you spent your immortality burying the people around you. Doesn’t any of this bother you? And you. Gustave’s dead. How can you keep going like nothing happened!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","4","Sciel","We need to continue."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","5","Maelle","Why do you-"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","6","Sciel","Maelle. You know what we must do. “When one falls…” Come on."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","0","Sciel","Merde!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","1","Lune","Are you hurt?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","2","Maelle","I’m fine- (groan of pain) Thanks."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","3","Verso","Ready?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","5","0","Verso","Well, turns out this Nevron wasn’t that strong, but you did well. You learn fast."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","5","1","Lune","All this. This is what we’re fighting for."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","0","Maelle","Is this the place?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","1","Verso","Yeah. We can bury your friend under this tree, if that’s okay with you."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","2","Maelle","Couldn’t wait for me, could you? I wish we could-"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","3","Lune","Rest easy, Gustave."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","4","Maelle","I’ll finish what you started. The Paintress. Renoir. They will pay."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","5","Sciel","No more Dome, just open skies."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","6","Maelle","I’ll save them, Gustave. Emma, your apprentices, everyone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","7","Lune","You can leave it to us."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","8","Sciel","You were always there for me."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","9","Maelle","I’ll save them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","10","Sciel","Say hi to Soph for me, yeah?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","11","Maelle","We could never tell if you were my brother or my father. But to me, you were both. The best brother and father I’ve ever had."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","12","Lune","“When one falls, we continue.”"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","13","Maelle","Thanks for being my family. See you… in the next life."
