"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","0","Maelle","Is it really dead?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","1","Gustave","Looks like it."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","2","Sciel","Is this it?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","3","Esquie","Ooooh! FLORRIE! All right! Ready to sail like a snail! Just jump, mes amis! It’s not that high!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","4","Lune","We can finally cross the sea."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","5","Sciel","You don’t happen to have some wine stashed away, do you?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","6","Esquie","Wine?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","7","Gustave","Hey, you can do this."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","8","Sciel","I hate water."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","9","Gustave","She doesn’t seem that far now, does she?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","10","Maelle","Yeah. Wanna throw one more rock?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","11","Gustave","The others are waiting, but…"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","12","Maelle","You might reach her."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","13","Gustave","Okay. Ooh, what about that one?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","14","Maelle","Does it really matter?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","15","Gustave","Well, you know, like I always say, it’s not about the rock, it’s more about the–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","16","Maelle","Gustave…"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","17","Gustave","Run."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","18","Maelle","Run… Please, run."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","19","Gustave","Why… Why are you doing this? We’ve done NOTHING to you. We should be on the same side. Let her go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","20","Sciel","Something’s going on up there."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","21","Lune","Esquie, get us up there!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","22","Esquie","I can’t!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","23","Lune","Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","6","0","Gustave","For those who come after, right?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","6","1","Maelle","No, no, no, no… You promised… GUSTAVE! Nonononono–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","6","2","White-haired man","You won’t yet understand. But this is a kindness, not a cruelty."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","0","Unknown woman","You let her come?! You know she’s too weak for this, how could you let her take such a risk?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","1","Unknown man","You only care when things are right in front of you. My sweet child, you were supposed to stay home. I told you not to worry. But since you’re here now, just stay put–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","2","Unknown woman","What are you saying? You must go home, NOW. This does not involve you."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","3","Unknown man","When this is over, we’ll go home together."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","4","Unknown woman","No!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","0","White-haired man","This won’t make sense to you now, but we both want what’s best for our families. I’m sorry you’re caught in the middle. But I did try to warn you. It’s been a while. Stay out of this. You chose to walk away. You don’t get to come back now and interfere."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","1","Stranger","You’ve lived more than a lifetime. It’s time to let her go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","2","White-haired man","A lifetime. A lifetime with my family torn apart. No, I want my family back."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","3","Stranger","It’s not your family. But she is."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","4","White-haired man","You would use her?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","5","Stranger","She chose to come. I didn’t make the rules between you two. Hey, are you alright? It’s okay. I’ll handle things here. Get back to your friends. Go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","6","White-haired man","So that’s it. You’ve set us down this path, but are you ready for the consequences?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","7","Stranger","She’ll never paint again."
