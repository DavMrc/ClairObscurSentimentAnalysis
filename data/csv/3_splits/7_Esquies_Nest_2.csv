"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","0","Maelle","I see why you like throwing rocks."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","1","Gustave","You’ve been quiet since you saw those people."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","2","Maelle","It felt like they knew me. Like they actually knew me. I don’t understand what’s happening. And, and I feel like I– I never understood. Like I’m always missing something that everyone else just gets. In Lumière, life never made sense and I never fit, and now out here, when it was just starting to maybe feel good, then this… this happens, and…"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","3","Gustave","Yeah, I hate it too. Things we don’t understand. They just make us feel small and powerless. But it helps, you know, to focus on the things I do understand. The people I care about and who care about me. And, uh, you know now I feel a little less lost, ‘cause at least, we’re lost together."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","4","Maelle","(laughs)"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","5","Gustave","What? Stop it. Too cheesy? Naah. Well, if it makes you feel better, I was even more lost when I was 16."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","6","Maelle","I heard that was because you were only thinking about girls."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","7","Gustave","Yeah, but guess what, the girls weren’t thinking about me. At all."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","8","Maelle","I believe that."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","9","Gustave","Yeah. You can talk to me, you know. We’re family. Or that’s what the paperwork says, at least."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","10","Maelle","Well, the paperwork probably says we’re dead, too, so…"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","11","Gustave","Yeah. Probably. Ooh, nice one."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","12","Maelle","I know."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","13","Gustave","I told you, don’t get cocky, it was… okay."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","9","14","Maelle","You taught me great. Nah."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","16","0","Masked woman","I envy them, those who can’t see. Those who know not, that they are not. And those who live, blithe and free, sins forgotten and thus absolved. A fresh dawn in their playground, while we live in shadows, swimming in ink. We are but a fragile dream, a singular weed, resisting, ever resisting. That iron dirt, that eternal law. Those who can’t see. Those who know not, that they are not. Do you know? We are fellows. Those who know not, that they are not."
