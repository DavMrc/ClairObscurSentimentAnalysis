"4","Flying Waters","5","0","Maelle","How did you find me?"
"4","Flying Waters","5","1","Gustave","There was a message at the Indigo Tree."
"4","Flying Waters","5","2","Lune","Do you know who left it?"
"4","Flying Waters","5","3","Maelle","A message? Maybe… No, I don’t know."
"4","Flying Waters","6","0","The Curator","(gibberish) …"
"4","Flying Waters","6","1","Maelle","Again? We just trained earlier!"
"4","Flying Waters","6","2","The Curator","(gibberish) …"
"4","Flying Waters","6","3","Maelle","Alright, alright. But this time, I have backup!"
"4","Flying Waters","7","0","The Curator","(gibberish) …"
"4","Flying Waters","7","1","Maelle","That was fun, but I think we’ve had enough training today."
"4","Flying Waters","7","2","The Curator","(gibberish) …"
"4","Flying Waters","7","3","Maelle","You could come with us, if you like?"
"4","Flying Waters","7","4","The Curator","(gibberish) …"
"4","Flying Waters","7","5","Maelle","If that’s a yes, we’ll see you at the camp."
"4","Flying Waters","7","6","The Curator","(gibberish) …"
"4","Flying Waters","9","0","Lune","… the manor and maybe learn something…"
"4","Flying Waters","9","1","Gustave","… yeah, or we could get back to the Indigo Tree…"
"4","Flying Waters","9","2","Maelle","Huh, Noco’s usually here, I wonder where–"
"4","Flying Waters","9","3","Lune","Is that– A Gestral??"
"4","Flying Waters","9","4","Noco","(gibberish) INTRUDERS! Oh, Verso would NOT be pleased. EN GARDE, RUFFIANTS!"
"4","Flying Waters","9","5","Maelle","Stop that, you big hairy brush face. Can’t you see they’re human? Noco’s a bit dramatic. But if you’re nice, Noco will trade you lots of useful items for chroma."
"4","Flying Waters","9","6","Noco","(gibberish) Hrmph. I don’t just trade with ANYONE. Only WORTHY WARRIORS! Are you worthy, moustache man?? Hmm, although, I do like that brush on your face."
"4","Flying Waters","9","7","Lune","So the tales are true– Perhaps the Grandis and the Esquie exist too? Are there more gestrals, like you? I’d love to meet them."
"4","Flying Waters","9","8","Noco","(gibberish) Maybe."
"4","Flying Waters","9","9","Maelle","Noco, you silly scruff! Their village is not far from here."
"4","Flying Waters","9","10","Lune","Oh, really?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","11","Gustave","Lune?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","12","Lune","I know. We don’t have time for detours."
"4","Flying Waters","9","13","Gustave","Yeah, we need to get to the Paintress."
"4","Flying Waters","9","14","Noco","(gibberish) The Paintress? How you gonna cross the sea? You’re so slow. And you have no fins."
"4","Flying Waters","9","15","Lune","There’s another sea between here and the Paintress?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","16","Maelle","Noco, as the BEST Gestral merchant ever, I bet you know a solution? Yeah?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","17","Noco","(gibberish) Mmmmmm. Maybe."
"4","Flying Waters","9","18","Maelle","COME ON, you broomhead. I know you know."
"4","Flying Waters","9","19","Noco","(gibberish) Ahaha, broomhead, that’s good! Excellent, excellent insult! Ok, ok, ask Golgra. Chef has the answer, just go to the Village. In the middle of our Ancient Sanctuary. Red trees everywhere, can’t miss it!"
"4","Flying Waters","9","20","Gustave","Well, I guess you’ll get to meet more Gestrals."
"4","Flying Waters","10","0","Lune","These dead Nevrons– Who could’ve done this?"
"4","Flying Waters","10","1","Maelle","Guess."
"4","Flying Waters","10","2","Gustave","So you didn’t just stay in your mansion. Guess we found 68’s boat."
"4","Flying Waters","10","3","Maelle","There’s a path through the boat."
"4","Flying Waters","10","4","Lune","That anchor doesn’t look man made…"
"4","Flying Waters","11","1","Gustave","So many– I don’t like this– Merde. This one is gigantic–"
"4","Flying Waters","11","2","Maelle","Avoid those at all costs."
"4","Flying Waters","13","0","Lune","Watch out!"
"4","Flying Waters","13","1","Gustave","You alright?"
"4","Flying Waters","13","2","Lune","It only attacked when–"
"4","Flying Waters","13","3","Maelle","It’s coming!"
"4","Flying Waters","14","0","Lune","Gustave, wait! It seems peaceful, as long as we don’t touch the flowers."
"4","Flying Waters","14","1","Gustave","Yeah, well, let’s not get too sentimental. It’s still a Paintress creation. PUTAIN! Damn, Maelle, what was that?"
"4","Flying Waters","14","2","Maelle","It felt… familiar, somehow…"
"4","Flying Waters","14","3","Lune","Gustave. We won’t understand what’s going on if we kill everything that moves."
"4","Flying Waters","14","4","Maelle","Look, a red tree. The Gestral village must be ahead."
"4","Flying Waters","14","5","Gustave","You know what Nevrons are capable of."
"4","Flying Waters","14","6","Lune","She’ll be fine."
"4","Flying Waters","14","7","Gustave","She’ll be fine."
