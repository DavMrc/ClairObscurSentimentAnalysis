"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","1","Sciel","Golgra said to shout the password “as loud as we can.” Well, Gustave, you’re the loudest."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","2","Gustave","Really? Hey."

"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","4","Gustave","Ahem. GET OUTTA MY WAY."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","5","Sunniso","Geez, you don’t need to be so rude."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","6","Gustave","Nonononono, uh… it’s just… um… it’s the password…"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","7","Sunniso","Well, I don’t know! Golgra never told me the password. But whatever, just go in."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","8","Gustave","Look. I am very sorry. It’s just that Golgra told us that’s the password and I–"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","9","Maelle","Come on, it’s a Gestral, he’ll have forgotten in about a minute."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","0","10","Gustave","I’m sorry."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","1","0","Sciel","Interesting decor."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","1","1","Lune","Esquie is said to feed on light."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","1","2","Gustave","Are you ok, Maelle?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","1","3","Maelle","I dunno. Getting a bit of … déjà vu again."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","1","4","Sciel","The light here– Feels a little– I dunno– Yeah."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","0","Lune","Hmmm, no Esquie–"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","1","Esquie","WOOOOOOOOOOOH! Bonjour, mes amis."

"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","3","Lune","Sciel."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","4","Sciel","What? I dunno, he seems nice."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","5","Esquie","Oh! It’s you! Hello again, my terrible swimmer friend. You’ve finally come to learn to swim!"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","6","Sciel","No? Uh. I’m not– I’m not that fond of water."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","7","Gustave","Uh. Actually, that’s sort of why we’re here. We need to cross the sea. Golgra said you could help?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","8","Esquie","Mon ami! “A rolling stone gathers no moss.”"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","9","Lune","Pardon me?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","10","Sciel","In the stories, they say Esquie like to speak in riddles."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","11","Esquie","In what way?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","12","Gustave","I don’t get it."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","13","Esquie","OHOHO!"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","14","Lune","We really need to cross the sea. Would you help us?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","15","Esquie","Mmm. There’s a lot of you to carry. I’m strong. But I’m not that strong. I will need Florrie."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","16","Sciel","Who’s Florrie?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","17","Esquie","One of my rocks!"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","18","Maelle","Rocks?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","19","Esquie","See, Florrie helps me swim. But Florrie was stolen by my archnemesis! The one whose every step SHAKES the foundation of the world! The one known as… François."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","20","Lune","Ok."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","21","Gustave","Let me guess. François is located deep in Nevron-infected territory, right?"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","22","Esquie","Oh, no, he’s right next door. Over there!"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","23","Gustave","Oh."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","24","Esquie","François is my neighbour."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","25","Gustave","Okay… Well, I guess we could take a look–"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","26","Esquie","FAN-TASTIC! Good luck, mes amis! Please, bring Florrie back to me."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","27","Sciel","You seem to know me."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","28","Esquie","Yes."
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","29","Sciel","How–? I don’t understand–"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","30","Esquie","“Men trip not on mountains, they stumble upon stones.”"
"7","Esquie’s Nest","2","31","Sciel","Okay…"
