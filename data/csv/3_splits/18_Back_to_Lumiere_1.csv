"18","Back to Lumière","3","0","Maelle","Papa did it so easily. What am I doing wrong?"
"18","Back to Lumière","3","1","Monoco","Don’t be discouraged. It’s only been a day since you remembered your Paintress side."
"18","Back to Lumière","3","2","Esquie","We believe in you!"
"18","Back to Lumière","3","3","Verso","Remember them. Painting isn’t about verisimilitude. It’s about essence. The truth of who they are. Your father made the Axons, right?"
"18","Back to Lumière","3","4","Monoco","She Who Plays with Wonder. He Who Guards Truth With Lies."
"18","Back to Lumière","3","5","Verso","They’re the essence of your mother. And… your brother."
"18","Back to Lumière","3","6","Lune","How did we—"
"18","Back to Lumière","3","7","Sciel","We gommaged…"
"18","Back to Lumière","3","8","Lune","Maelle… Your hair?"
"18","Back to Lumière","3","9","Maelle","We have much to talk about."
"18","Back to Lumière","4","0","Lune","So you are her daughter. And you are a Paintress too."
"18","Back to Lumière","4","1","Esquie","So cool, right??"
"18","Back to Lumière","4","2","Lune","And you. You knew this whole time. You fucking coward. You betrayed us. We trusted you and you—"
"18","Back to Lumière","4","3","Sciel","You can bring them back too, yeah? Everyone we’ve lost."
"18","Back to Lumière","4","4","Maelle","I— Yeah. But I need chroma. And Papa controls all the chroma in the Canvas."
"18","Back to Lumière","4","5","Lune","No. Not all of it. The Expeditioners, the ones killed by Nevrons. Gustave noticed their Chroma remains in their bodies. They never dissipated, like the Gommage."
"18","Back to Lumière","4","6","Maelle","Hmmm. It’s old chroma, not pure. It won’t be like bringing the two of you back, but… we could use it in other ways."
"18","Back to Lumière","4","7","Monoco","Time for the greatest Expedition in history."
"18","Back to Lumière","5","0","Esquie","Oooooh, everyone’s mad at you."
"18","Back to Lumière","5","1","Verso","Are you?"
"18","Back to Lumière","5","2","Esquie","Esquie can be sad or bad or even rad! But never ever mad. Bad things happen when we get mad."
"18","Back to Lumière","5","3","Verso","Oh, I know."
"18","Back to Lumière","5","4","Esquie","But I can never be mad at you."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","0","Sciel","Save it."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","1","Verso","…"
"18","Back to Lumière","6","2","Sciel","I don’t need your mea culpa. You did what you felt you had to. Of course, you were wrong, but… oh, well."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","3","Verso","I thought you’d be more upset."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","4","Sciel","I was. I got over it."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","5","Verso","…"
"18","Back to Lumière","6","6","Sciel","Everything I knew about our world is wrong. And you know what? I don’t care. ‘Cause death isn’t death anymore. And that means, I can see my husband again."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","7","Verso","Sciel…"
"18","Back to Lumière","6","8","Sciel","Oh, please. I’d sacrifice you in a heartbeat to get him back, so… I understand. We’re good."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","9","Verso","Thank you."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","10","Sciel","As long as you help me bring Pierre back. You owe me."
"18","Back to Lumière","6","11","Verso","You got it."
