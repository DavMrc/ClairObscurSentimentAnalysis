"12","Old Lumière","5","0","Verso","Can you stand? Monoco gets a bit carried away sometimes."
"12","Old Lumière","5","1","Maelle","My back hurts, but I’m fine."
"12","Old Lumière","5","2","Verso","Good. The others are probably heading toward the centre of the city. We’ll rejoin them there."
"12","Old Lumière","5","3","Noco","(gibberish) And find treasure along the way!"
"12","Old Lumière","5","4","Maelle","Feels like home."
"12","Old Lumière","5","5","Verso","yeah, feels like home. You ok?"
"12","Old Lumière","5","6","Maelle","Monoco fits well in the Disaster Expedition, eh?"
"12","Old Lumière","5","7","Verso","Yeah, he does. After you."
"12","Old Lumière","6","0","Maelle","Speaking of home, where’d you live in Lumière?"
"12","Old Lumière","6","1","Verso","Above a bakery near the centre. Um… Angelique’s Boulangerie! I ate there every morning. I wonder if it’s still there."
"12","Old Lumière","6","2","Maelle","It’s called “Mathilde”s” now. When this is over, you should go and visit."
"12","Old Lumière","8","0","Maelle","We’re a pretty good team. Verso? VERSO? Putain. What- Where did he go? Verso, where did you go… I need to find Lune and Sciel. Quickly."
"12","Old Lumière","8","1","Noco","(gibberish) Hihihi. I’m still here! Don’t worry, Verso runs off all the time. He’s always ditching me and Monoco. He’ll be back."
"12","Old Lumière","9","0","Verso","I knew you’d open the door for her. Merde."
"12","Old Lumière","9","1","Renoir","Really, Verso? This was your plan? How many times must you hurt our family."
"12","Old Lumière","9","2","Verso","No. No, you don’t get to lecture ME on family."
"12","Old Lumière","9","3","Renoir","Why do you refuse to see I am doing this for us? Yet you insist on rushing toward death. You’re trying to stop the wrong cycle."
"12","Old Lumière","9","4","Verso","You’re doing this for yourself."
"12","Old Lumière","9","5","Renoir","Of course, it’s easier for you to think that, isn’t it? Easier to betray us, if I’m the villain."
"12","Old Lumière","9","6","Maelle","Verso, move. I’m gonna fucking kill him."
"12","Old Lumière","9","7","Renoir","You haven’t told her the truth, have you, son?"
"12","Old Lumière","9","8","Lune","Sorry, we’re late, we were busy doing a bit of reading. Were you planning on sharing that this man, the man who murdered our team, is your father?"
"12","Old Lumière","9","9","Verso","Family is not my favourite topic. right, can we talk about this later? I’d really like for you all to survive this."
