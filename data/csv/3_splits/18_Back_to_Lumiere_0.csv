"18","Back to Lumière","0","0","Verso","Alicia?"
"18","Back to Lumière","0","1","Maelle","Actually, I prefer “Maelle.”"
"18","Back to Lumière","0","2","Verso","I think I do too. But I’m not really Verso, and you’re not really Maelle, are you?"
"18","Back to Lumière","0","3","Maelle","You’re not Verso, no. You look and sound just like him. But you’re you. I’m still Maelle though. You should’ve helped me remember."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","4","Verso","Yeah. I… I wanted to— but I… I’m sorry."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","5","Maelle","I’m sorry too. If I’d listened to Maman— If I hadn’t trusted the Writers, Verso would still be alive, and you—"
"18","Back to Lumière","0","6","Verso","Wouldn’t exist."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","7","Maelle","Wouldn’t be caught in the middle. Maman did a terrible thing, painting you into Verso’s Canvas. Giving you his memories. Pretending the fire only took me. But I’m glad you exist."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","8","Verso","Your father was right to erase everyone. It’s better this way."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","9","Maelle","Better for who? Verso would have never wanted his Canvas gone. He loved Esquie and his Gestrals and Grandis."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","10","Verso","It was killing my… our mother, staying here so long in a make-believe world with her make-believe family."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","11","Maelle","It’s not make-believe. It’s not… You’re not… To me. Papa’s here. He’ll help me fix Lumière."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","12","Verso","Will he?"
"18","Back to Lumière","0","13","Maelle","Maman painted a rather unflattering portrait of him. He’s much warmer than the Renoir you know."
"18","Back to Lumière","0","14","Verso","I bet."
"18","Back to Lumière","1","0","Verso","Your father was the one erasing everyone. Why would he help repaint everything?"
"18","Back to Lumière","1","1","Maelle","I hid the Canvas before I entered, so Maman can’t come back again. There’s no need to erase the Canvas anymore."
"18","Back to Lumière","1","2","Verso","He’ll want you to go home."
"18","Back to Lumière","1","3","Maelle","I’m not at risk like Maman. I haven’t been in this Canvas that long. Besides, Papa has a soft spot for me, he’ll listen."
"18","Back to Lumière","1","4","Verso","Hmm."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","0","Maelle","Papa!"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","1","Renoir","Alicia. You’re safe. I thought I told you to stay home."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","2","Maelle","Technically my body’s at home."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","3","Renoir","Some of Aline’s finest work. I regret that it caused you so much pain. What Aline did was unfair, to you most of all. Please, accept the Dessendre family’s apologies. I know it seems absurd to offer oblivion as recompense, but perhaps that’s the outcome we both desire."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","4","Maelle","What—"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","5","Renoir","I’m proud of you. Getting your mother out of the Canvas was not easy. But once we erase the Canvas, we won’t have to worry anymore."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","6","Maelle","But she’s home now, why—"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","7","Renoir","You know your mother. Verso painted this Canvas, it contains a piece of his soul. She’ll never willingly part with it."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","8","Maelle","No."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","9","Renoir","For the sake of the living, we must part with the dead."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","10","Maelle","No, Papa, see, I hid the canvas—"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","11","Renoir","She will always find it. This is our only opportunity, while she’s too sick from her prolonged descent into the canvas to return."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","12","Maelle","But— No… Papa, Papa, please. This is Verso’s only Canvas. You can’t destroy the last piece of him that we have. This is my home now! You can’t just decide—"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","13","Renoir","Your home? After all that with your mother, you want to stay?"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","14","Maelle","You know how little remains of my life. Outside."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","15","Renoir","Alicia. You’ll die. You’ve already been here longer than you should."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","16","Maelle","But—"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","17","Renoir","No. Look at me, I said no. I am not letting my daughter risk her life. Alicia."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","18","Maelle","I’m not Maman. I’m not going to lose myself if I stay!"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","19","Renoir","I know full well you will. And I am not doing this again."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","20","Maelle","No! Papa, what are you—"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","21","Renoir","It’s time to go home."
"18","Back to Lumière","2","22","Esquie","Mes amis!"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","23","Monoco","All aboard!"
"18","Back to Lumière","2","24","Maelle","Verso, come on. Come on! I can see them."
