"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","0","Maelle","Hey…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","1","Lune","Hey…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","2","Maelle","Um… I, um… I didn’t mean…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","3","Lune","It’s fine."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","4","Maelle","I just…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","5","Lune","I miss him too."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","6","Maelle","It’s… it’s hard."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","7","Lune","… The pain we feel… everytime we lose someone… I’ve tried many ways of dealing with it. Running from it. Sitting with it. Compartmentalising it. But what I needed… was to use it. To use everything."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","8","Maelle","What do you mean?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","9","Lune","I- Mm."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","10","Maelle","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","11","Lune","(exhale) I feel… everything… And I let it burn inside me. When I’m tired, when I feel hopeless, when I want to just let it all go… I use the pain, I use the fear, the shame, the guilt, the anger, I use it all to keep going. To make sure. I. Continue."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","12","Maelle","Lune…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","13","Lune","I can almost feel them beside me. Everyone we’ve lost… walking with me. Especially when I use chroma. I feel their presence, their closeness. And they help me."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","14","Maelle","You feel Gustave?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","15","Lune","Yeah, I do."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","16","Maelle","I’d like to feel him with me too…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","17","Lune","You have an affinity for chroma too. Try it."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","18","Maelle","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","19","Lune","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","20","Maelle","How do you always know what to do…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","21","Lune","I don’t. Want to know a secret? I have no idea what I’m doing. And I don’t think anyone else does either."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","22","Maelle","Huh. Really?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","23","Lune","Don’t tell anyone else I said that."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","24","Maelle","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","0","Maelle","Thanks. It really was a beautiful place."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","1","Verso","Glad you liked it. I’ve buried friends there too. You were right. About condolences. We offer them, because we don’t know what else to say. But there’s no comfort there."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","2","Maelle","No."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","3","Verso","All we can do is carry them with us."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","4","Maelle","I guess. Sorry. It’s just- We’re…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","5","Verso","Drowning in our own sadness? Hey. Why did you join the Expedition? I mean, with the Gommage- I understand the rest of the team’s decision, but you’re half their age."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","6","Maelle","Out here seemed better than in there. At the time."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","7","Verso","It’s natural, wanting to escape a life you don’t want."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","8","Maelle","Escape. yeah. That’s what I wanted. But Gustave and the others… They really want to change things."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","9","Verso","Changing your life also counts. Can’t always shoulder the world’s problems, you know? That’ll drain you fast."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","10","Maelle","Gustave would probably say, if more of us cared, then it would lighten the load for everyone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","11","Verso","He sounds like a good guy."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","12","Maelle","Wait. I kept Gustave’s. So you can have mine. You’ll need one if you want to be an official member of our merry crew."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","13","Verso","I gotta say, I didn’t take you for an “official” kind of person."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","14","Maelle","Welcome to the Disaster Expedition."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","15","Verso","Thank you."
