"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","0","Tristan","I just finished calibrating the Lumina Converter. We can launch test runs as soon as we land."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","1","Gustave","Perfect."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","2","Tristan","Hey. Does Lune seem preoccupied to you? She’s been distant lately."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","3","Gustave","Well. It’s Lune."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","4","Tristan","Mm. This feels different."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","5","Gustave","I haven’t noticed anything, but you know her better. Have you talked to her?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","6","Tristan","Nah, she doesn’t like people prying. I’ve known her since we were six. She hates personal questions."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","7","Gustave","Ah right, you were both apprenticed to her parents."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","8","Tristan","Yeaahh. Let’s just say, they ran a tight ship."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","9","Gustave","Mmm. I can imagine."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","0","Bastien","Ready for tomorrow?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","1","Gustave","Yeah– Been ready. What about you? Heard you were elected “Commander 32.” Congrats."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","2","Bastien","I’ve already claimed Alan’s office. It’s got a nicer view than mine."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","3","Gustave","A view of the Paintress? You’re sicker than I thought."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","4","Bastien","She won’t be there for long."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","5","Gustave","Mmmm. If we– If we fail though…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","6","Bastien","“When one falls, we continue.” We’ll pick up, and we’ll push on. But I know. We will meet again."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","0","Gustave","I can’t believe you’re working right now."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","1","Lune","Mm. Tristan dragged me here."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","2","Gustave","Is that the final spot? It’s amazing you triangulated Expedition Zero’s landing site."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","3","Lune","Theoretically. I extrapolated from the archives, but… it was 67 years ago. So much of the landscape has changed."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","4","Gustave","I trust your calculations."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","5","Lune","Thanks."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","6","Gustave","It’s a good strategy, retracing their steps. They’re the only expedition with any survivors, and they made it to the Monolith so…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","7","Lune","Assuming the records are correct, my calculations are correct, that they left clear markers, that the road conditions haven’t changed–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","8","Gustave","You need a drink."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","9","Lune","Go away, Gustave."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","0","Gustave","Hey."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","1","Catherine","Hey yourself. You ok? Wanna talk about it?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","2","Gustave","Yeah, umm. Actually, no."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","3","Catherine","That’s ok."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","4","Gustave","What about you? You say goodbye to Derrick?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","5","Catherine","Oh, that was over ages ago."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","6","Gustave","Oh. Sorry–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","7","Catherine","Eh."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","8","Gustave","–I really thought you guys would work out."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","9","Catherine","It’s for the best. I need full focus on the Expedition. And our team. We’re all we have."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","10","Gustave","Yeah, we’re all we have."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","0","Lucien","Glass of wine? Or a hug?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","1","Gustave","Keep your sweat to yourself."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","2","Lucien","Bring Gustave a glass of wine!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","3","Gustave","Who, exactly, are you talking to? They cut servers from the budget years ago."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","4","Lucien","Ah. The ultimate indignity. A farewell party where we serve ourselves. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","5","Gustave","Mmmm. I’m betting you’ve got another bottle stashed in your coat somewhere. You gonna share?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","6","Lucien","You wound me. But yes, in fact, I do have a bottle. “Always be prepared.” Or was it “Always bring backup?” Eh. Same difference."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","7","Gustave","Right."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","8","Lucien","And I AM prepared! Prepared to live. AND. Prepared to die."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","9","Gustave","You’re such an idiot."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","10","Lucien","Hey. Heyheyheyheyhey. We’ve got your Lumina Converter, yeah? I. BELIEVE. I’m ready for my Lumina!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","11","Gustave","Yeah, well, we’ve only tested it here. Who knows what we’ll meet on the main continent. We’ll need more field-testing once we land."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","12","Lucien","Don’t worry, buddy. I’ve got you covered."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","13","Gustave","Great. Thanks, buddy."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","0","Alexandre","Gustave! We got something for you. For your field notes. So when you come back, you can tell us EVERYTHING. They’ll definitely want that for the Museum! The complete record of the Expedition that DESTROYED the Paintress!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","1","Guillaume","Oh, and if you find journals from the other Expeditions, make sure you save them for us!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","2","Gustave","I shall faithfully record ALL of our adventures. Every strange and wondrous thing."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","3","Alexandre","And Nevrons!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","4","Gustave","I can do that. And in return, do you solemnly promise to take care of the Shield Dome while I’m gone? I’m entrusting you with the safety of Lumière."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","5","Alexandre","I promise."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","6","Guillaume","Promise!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","7","Gustave","Adrien?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","8","Adrien","I’ll use everything you taught us, Monsieur G."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","9","Alexandre","Oh, hey, Gustave, your sister’s here!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","10","Gustave","Yeah, I have to go talk to her. Take care of each other."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","0","Gustave","My darling sister has arrived, she’ll kill me if I don’t say goodbye. The Chief Councilor honours us with her presence. What? You still mad I’m going?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","1","Emma","This is the definition of a fool’s quest, and my brother’s not usually a fool."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","2","Gustave","I’ve heard you say otherwise."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","3","Emma","You and I both know the political complexities that necessitate the Expedition. It’s vital for morale, but it’s a bloodless guillotine, is what it is–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","4","Gustave","You should put that in your speech. Very motivating. They might just find a guillotine for you too."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","5","Emma","There are so many things you can contribute to HERE, in Lumière. That’ll have a REAL impact."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","6","Gustave","Em. You’re doing great work– Really. Getting things ready for the Last Generation– You’ve got it well in-hand here. Let me do my part, out there, and win us a chance to LIVE."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","7","Emma","We’re never going to see each other again."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","12","Gustave","Don’t you have a speech to give?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","13","Emma","You mean the one you so kindly wrote to me?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","14","Gustave","Just suggestions! I thought it might help you understand–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","15","Emma","I do. Understand. I just– Anyway. Yeah, time for my speech."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","26","0","Emma","Expeditioners. The Sword of Lumière. We honour your dedication. We do not take for granted that you dedicate your final year of life to keeping hope alive for all of Lumière. Some of you are leaving to change the world. Others to discover the secrets of our universe. Some to protect loved ones. Others to find meaning in our all-too-short lives. As you sail into the unknown, know that Lumière stands with you. When you battle the Paintress, know that Lumière fights with you. Let the stones of her Monolith crumble. Let her body lie at the end of the world, unable to paint another death. Let the stars no longer be hidden by her oppressive silhouette. Let the world once again watch the sun rise without the shadow of her cursed figure. May the wind of renewal take you to the ends of the earth. Tomorrow comes. Thanks to you, Expedition 33."
