"18","Back to Lumière","7","0","Verso","Lune…"
"18","Back to Lumière","7","1","Lune","I was right not to trust you."
"18","Back to Lumière","7","2","Verso","And what would you have done in my position?"
"18","Back to Lumière","7","3","Lune","I wouldn’t have betrayed my expedition. I would have warned them that everyone they cared about was about to be erased. That THEY were about to be erased. I would have told them the truth. Because after everything we’ve been through, we deserved that."
"18","Back to Lumière","7","4","Verso","So you’d choose your expedition over your mother?"
"18","Back to Lumière","7","5","Lune","That’s your problem, you think in false dichotomies. It wasn’t an “either/or” situation. Other solutions were possible, if you’d only trusted us enough to ask."
"18","Back to Lumière","7","6","Verso","Knowing what you know now, would you have helped me force my mother out of the Canvas?"
"18","Back to Lumière","7","7","Lune","…"
"18","Back to Lumière","7","8","Verso","I don’t apologise for saving her. But I am sorry I broke your trust. And I will do everything I can to help bring everyone back."
"18","Back to Lumière","7","9","Lune","I guess we’ll see…"
"18","Back to Lumière","8","0","Monoco","Not to say I told you so, but I do believe that I did in fact… tell you so."
"18","Back to Lumière","8","1","Verso","Thanks for the support."
"18","Back to Lumière","8","2","Monoco","Was it worth it?"
"18","Back to Lumière","8","3","Verso","…"
"18","Back to Lumière","8","4","Monoco","What will you do now?"
"18","Back to Lumière","8","5","Verso","I’ll do my best to earn their trust back."
"18","Back to Lumière","8","6","Monoco","Quite a steep hill to climb."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","0","Maelle","We have to push Papa out of the Canvas before he erases everything."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","1","Verso","I’m surprised he hasn’t already."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","2","Maelle","He’s been weakened by his battle with Maman. That’s probably why he hasn’t come after us. But it won’t stop him for long."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","3","Verso","If you and your father keep fighting, you risk breaking the world again. Another Fracture, but this time, it might be you trapped inside the Monolith."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","4","Maelle","What’s the alternative?"
"18","Back to Lumière","9","5","Verso","Maybe… Maybe you should go home."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","6","Maelle","Verso…"
"18","Back to Lumière","9","7","Verso","You’re fighting each other, but you’re all doing the same thing."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","8","Maelle","No."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","9","Verso","Aline wants her son back. Renoir wants you and Aline back. You want Gustave back. The cycle we needed to break wasn’t the Gommage. It’s your family’s cycle of grief."
"18","Back to Lumière","9","10","Maelle","…"
"18","Back to Lumière","9","11","Verso","Our whole world carries the burden of your family’s grief."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","0","Sciel","Nice hair."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","1","Maelle","Oh, yeah, that."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","2","Lune","I can’t believe there’s another world out there. A world I’ll never get to see."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","3","Maelle","I’m sorry. I didn’t— My memories— I would’ve told you if I’d known—"
"18","Back to Lumière","11","4","Lune","Don’t apologise. You were trapped too. You lived among us. You’re one of us. Even if you’re also one of them."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","5","Maelle","It’s… so weird. I have memories of two childhoods. Two homes. Two Lumières."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","6","Sciel","You’re not an orphan anymore. You just found your family. Don’t you want to be with them?"
"18","Back to Lumière","11","7","Maelle","I love my family, but… they’re all gone. In one way or another. And you’re my family too. So are Gustave and Emma. And I didn’t see it at the time, but all the families who took turn taking care of me…"
"18","Back to Lumière","11","8","Sciel","Maelle."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","9","Lune","This is a lot to take in."
"18","Back to Lumière","11","10","Sciel","Yeah. But for the first time in a long time, I have hope."
