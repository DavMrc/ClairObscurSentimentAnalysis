"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","0","Verso","… for about two hours then there’s a big lake. We shouldn’t go there. At all. Like it’s- We should make a right and then it’s going to take a few hours, and then we make a stop, we get some rest and some food, and then from there, we head north to Monoco’s Station."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","1","Lune","Why there?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","2","Verso","To recruit my oldest friend. We’ll need the extra firepower, because our next goal will be to take down the Paintress’ heart."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","3","Sciel","Her heart?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","4","Verso","Yes. You can’t just stroll up to the Paintress. The Chroma there is far too dense, it erases anyone who gets close. But if we destroy her heart, the barrier will fall."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","5","Lune","Ok. So where is this heart? What does it look like?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","6","Verso","What does it look like? That, I don’t know. But I do know that it’s somewhere in the centre of Old Lumière."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","7","Sciel","You found Old Lumière?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","8","Verso","Yes."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","9","Lune","So it’s true. Before the Fracture, our Lumière was part of a larger city on the continent."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","10","Verso","I’ve travelled with many Expeditions. I was with the 58s when we found Old Lumière. But Renoir erased them, before we could get further. And I don’t know much more."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","11","Lune","Alright then. Let’s go meet your friend at Monoco’s Station. And then we’ll take the Paintress’ heart."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","0","Sciel","How far up the mountain is Monoco’s Station? Will we see snow?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","1","Verso","Not too high but yeah, there’s usually snow."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","2","Sciel","Ah, fantastic!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","3","Verso","Oh, right, there’s no snow in Lumière."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","4","Sciel","No, only in books and paintings; it’s almost as mythical as gestrals!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","5","Verso","And just as fun. And sometimes just as deadly."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","6","Sciel","Oh, really? My husband was obsessed with the idea of snow. I can’t wait to see some."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","0","Lune","Your older friend is a gestral?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","1","Verso","Yes, we’ve been friends for as long as I can remember."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","2","Lune","Gustave would have loved that."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","3","Verso","Why? Because he liked Gestrals?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","4","Lune","Because… he liked the idea of friendships that could last decades. We don’t get to enjoy such long friendships in Lumière."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","0","Maelle","How come Monoco lives so far from the other gestrals?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","1","Verso","Monoco’s a “Searcher.” They travel the land looking for Gestrals who went missing after the Fracture."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","2","Maelle","The Lost Gestrals."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","3","Verso","Yeah. That, and he pissed off Golgra."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","0","Sciel","What’re you working on?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","1","Lune","Contingency plans. If we fail, Expedition 32 will need every bit of information we have."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","2","Sciel","Right, but how’re you gonna get it to them?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","3","Lune","I asked the Gestrals for help."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","4","Sciel","Smart."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","5","Lune","What are the stars whispering to you?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","6","Sciel","Actually, I’m the one whispering to them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","7","Lune","Oh?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","8","Sciel","It’s something my dad and I used to do. When I was scared or anxious, or even when I was happy. He’d say… “share it with the stars… When it’s hard to talk about things… The stars’ll understand.”"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","9","Lune","I like that."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","10","Sciel","I talked to the stars a lot, after he was gone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","11","Lune","I remember. The night we first met. At the Crooked Tower."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","12","Sciel","Right. After the Gommage."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","13","Lune","I was surprised to find you here. I thought I was the only one who knew about that room."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","14","Sciel","I had to go away from the harbour. And those damn petals everywhere. So I climbed up."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","15","Lune","It wasn’t logical, but part of me really believed my parents and their expedition had succeeded. That they’d stopped Her. Then the Paintress woke. And I knew they weren’t coming home."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","16","Sciel","You know, it meant a lot to me, the comfort we shared that day. But you avoided me after. Why?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","17","Lune","I- It wasn’t personal. I- I cut a lot of people out of my life."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","18","Sciel","Ok. Not personal."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","19","Lune","That day, I knew my parents had failed. They were counting on me to finish their work. I couldn’t afford distractions."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","20","Sciel","Friends are not distractions."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","21","Lune","I know that now."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","22","Sciel","Well. We’re in the middle of nowhere with one year left to live. What better time to build friendships?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","23","Lune","Mm, I could use some wine though."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","24","Sciel","Making friends is thirsty work."
