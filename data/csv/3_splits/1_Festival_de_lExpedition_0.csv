"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","0","Lucien","There you are! You can’t hide from us, you know. Like I said, mourning’s best done with friends."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","1","Catherine","Lucien."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","2","Lucien","What? It is. Grieving alone is the worst."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","3","Catherine","Where’s mine?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","4","Lucien","Santé, les amis!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","5","Catherine","Santé!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","6","Gustave","Yeah– Yeah, yeah, no, I could use a drink."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","7","Catherine","Five tables this year, you see that? Told you we’d beat the 34s. Even Maelle showed up, and she hates these things. Wanna go take a look?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","8","Gustave","Uh, I don’t– Maybe later. I’ll catch up. I’m okay. I’m okay. You go."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","9","Lucien","Yeah. Time for a refill anyway."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","10","Catherine","There’s an “excess of wine” again. Thank your sister for her generosity."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","11","Lucien","Oh, and try to enjoy yourself. Don’t drink alone, you weirdo!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","12","Gustave","Yeah, right. Enjoy myself. I should check on Maelle, she’s probably alone, as usual. Let’s at least check on Maelle and my apprentices."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","0","Gustave","I knew I’d find you here. Having second thoughts about the Expedition?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","1","Maelle","Please. I’m more ready to go than you are."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","2","Gustave","Yeah, I know."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","3","Maelle","…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","4","Gustave","I know we’ve been over this, but as your guardian, I need to say this one more time. The rest of us only have a year left, but you’ve got nine good years before your Gommage. You don’t need to leave yet. It’s a lot of risk."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","5","Maelle","One year out there’s better than nine years in here."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","6","Gustave","I know you think that but–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","7","Maelle","If anyone should stay, it’s you. You have friends and family who want you here–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","8","Gustave","So do you–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","9","Maelle","No, I don’t."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","10","Gustave","Emma thinks of you as family–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","11","Maelle","Lumière’s not my home. Not the way it is for you. Besides, this way I can keep an eye on you for Emma."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","12","Gustave","Right, ‘cause she needs eyes everywhere."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","13","Maelle","Shush. You’re lucky you have a sister who cares."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","14","Gustave","Doubly lucky, since now I have two."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","15","Maelle","Alright, enough chit chat. C’mon, old man, let’s have a duel."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","16","Gustave","“Old man?”"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","17","Maelle","You’re pretty much the oldest man in Lumière, now, non? C’mon. This time, I’m not messing around! Hope your Lumina Converter works better than your duelling."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","2","0","Gustave","Not bad for the oldest man in Lumière, eh?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","2","1","Maelle","Congratulations, you beat a teenager. Take this token as your well deserved prize. Don’t get too drunk tonight, okay?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","2","2","Gustave","Hmmm, where are my scallywag apprentices? I promised to find them at the festival."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","3","0","Jules","Wow, so many Expeditioners! So cool!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","0","Jules","That’s… He made that overnight? Dad… Damn, now I feel stupid for fighting with him… Dad…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","1","Gustave","…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","2","Jules","You take it."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","3","Gustave","What?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","4","Jules","I’m not sure I’ll ever use it. Maybe I’ll go blind like my father, or maybe another expedition will succeed. I want to support the Expedition now. Take it. It may be useful to you."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","5","Gustave","…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","6","Jules","It’s ok. I don’t need the uniform to know my dad’s with me."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","7","Gustave","Thanks."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","0","Michel","Come, let’s play some cards."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","1","Gustave","No way. Everyone knows you cheat."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","2","Michel","That’s just what sore losers say. Come now, you gonna be a little cautious mouse with the Paintress too?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","3","Gustave","“Cautious” is good. Keeps you alive."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","4","Michel","Meh. We’re EXPEDITIONERS. Stay smart, yes, but be BOLD, eh? You can’t win if you don’t play."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","5","Gustave","Money’s no good out there anyway. Why’re you trying to fleece me?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","6","Michel","‘Cause winning is fun."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","0","Seba","Gustave! Come drink with me!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","1","Gustave","I’m pacing myself tonight."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","2","Seba","Oh, you’re so boring. It’s our last night! Who knows when we’ll be back."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","3","Gustave","I like that you say “when” and not “if.”"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","4","Seba","What can I say? I’m an optimist. Or an idiot. Depends on who you ask."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","0","Tom","Hey, Gustave, check out the new Pictos I made!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","1","Gustave","Looks a bit rough. You sure it works?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","2","Tom","I’ve been working on this for months. It’s my personal masterpiece."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","3","Gustave","Your personal masterpiece seems a little… unorthodox."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","4","Tom","It’s dead useful, trust me. C’mon, give it a whirl."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","5","Gustave","Sure, why not…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","6","Tom","Great. I’ll trade it for one token."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","7","Gustave","Call it morbid curiosity. Here. Your token."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","8","Tom","You won’t regret it. Probably."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","0","Gustave","Hey, Amandine, having fun?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","1","Amandine","Oh, hey, handsome, perfect timing. I’m styling everyone before we ship out. Gotta look sharp when we hit the Paintress, eh?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","2","Gustave","Certainly important. Can you style me up too?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","3","Amandine","On it. Just bring me a token first."
