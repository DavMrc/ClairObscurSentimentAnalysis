"28","Let’s save Lumière","0","0","Maelle","Wait for us here. It’s dangerous for you near Papa. We’ll have to move fast, I can’t maintain them for very long. Tomorrow comes."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","3","1","Verso","Your father. He’s at the tower."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","3","2","Maelle","Yes."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","3","3","Lune","Maelle…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","2","Sciel","Your father’s been extra inspired."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","3","Monoco","A most enticing challenge."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","4","Maelle","Papa’s over there. And the chroma we need to bring back Lumière."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","5","Sciel","Even I can sense him…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","6","Lune","We’d better make sure we’re ready."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","0","Maelle","Papa."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","1","Renoir","Alicia."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","2","Maelle","Please. I just want you to understand what this Canvas means to me-"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","3","Renoir","I do understand. I know how powerful and intoxicating it is, how deeply attached we can become to the worlds we pour our hearts and souls into. I was enthralled and it nearly killed me."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","4","Maelle","That doesn’t mean you have to erase Verso’s Canvas!"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","5","Renoir","Child, do you think I want to? After all the sorrows we’ve endured, do you really think that I want to destroy that last piece of his soul?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","6","Maelle","Then don’t. Don’t."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","7","Renoir","Life keeps forcing cruel choices. We do what we must."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","8","Sciel","Grief often blinds us. And we make choices we can never take back."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","9","Renoir","You grieve for two."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","10","Sciel","I grieve for many."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","11","Lune","The choices of parents leave indelible marks upon their children. But ultimately, the voices in their head have to be their own. You cannot set the boundaries of their life for them."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","12","Maelle","After the fire—You wanted me to find—new joy in life. And I tried. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t. Verso died because of ME. How do I get from that to joy?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","13","Renoir","Child, it will get better. I promise you. But this is not the way. Your friends speak truth, and it changes nothing. You can hate me, but that’s a choice I must make. As your father, I must look out for you. Especially when you can’t look out for yourself."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","14","Maelle","You treat me as if I’m still five…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","15","Renoir","I treat you as if the shadow from the worst day of our lives is going to suffocate you and take you from us too. Enough. I said enough."
