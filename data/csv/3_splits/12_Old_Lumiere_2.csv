"12","Old Lumière","10","0","Verso","Everyone all right? Monoco?"
"12","Old Lumière","10","1","Monoco","Noco’s- broken."
"12","Old Lumière","10","2","Renoir","Why can’t you accept who you are?"
"12","Old Lumière","10","3","Verso","ALICIA, MOVE!"
"12","Old Lumière","10","4","Maelle","What is tha- Will you… Tell me your name?"
"12","Old Lumière","10","5","Verso","Putain! Where did it go? No, no, no, no. Alicia! Fuck! (angry roar)"
"12","Old Lumière","11","0","Esquie","Oooooh Dorrie! Thank you, mon amie!"
"12","Old Lumière","11","1","Lune","Care to explain? Your father?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","2","Verso","I don’t think of him as my father anymore."
"12","Old Lumière","11","3","Sciel","Still. Why didn’t you just tell us?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","4","Verso","Because it’s private and it’s painful. And it’s none of your business. I cut ties with him decades ago."
"12","Old Lumière","11","5","Lune","Lying by omission is still lying."
"12","Old Lumière","11","6","Verso","I’ve told you everything you need to know-"
"12","Old Lumière","11","7","Lune","I’d rather make that determination for myself."
"12","Old Lumière","11","8","Sciel","I think we can all understand where each other’s wyoming from. Right? He hasn’t steered us wrong yet. But we’re a team now. And we won’t get very far if we don’t trust each other."
"12","Old Lumière","11","9","Maelle","Family- is complicated."
"12","Old Lumière","11","10","Lune","The stories say that Gestrals reincarnate? Is that true? Can you bring Noco back?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","11","Monoco","Partially. We can bring Noco back to life, but not all of Noco will return. It will be- a different Noco. The one you knew is gone."
"12","Old Lumière","11","12","Verso","I’m- I am so very sorry, my friend. And all… all for naught. The Paintress’ heart was in that manor and now it’s gone. We have no way to access the Monolith."
"12","Old Lumière","11","13","Lune","Expedition 58 seemed to think you knew another way."
"12","Old Lumière","11","14","Verso","What?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","15","Lune","We found 58 and their journals."
"12","Old Lumière","11","16","Verso","So that’s how you- I wasn’t hiding it, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s a dead end."
"12","Old Lumière","11","17","Maelle","Wait, what’re you talking about?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","18","Lune","There is someone else who can help us."
