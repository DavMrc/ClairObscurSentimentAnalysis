"16","The Monolith","12","0","Maelle","Is that- You…"
"16","The Monolith","12","1","Verso","We’re taking her down."
"16","The Monolith","12","2","Renoir","She’s not the only one who grieves. The pain of losing you… She made me inherit it. Punishment, perhaps, for not being there when it mattered. I refuse to lose my son."
"16","The Monolith","12","3","Verso","That son was a stranger."
"16","The Monolith","12","4","Renoir","But you’re not. You’re not."
"16","The Monolith","12","5","Verso","You lost me years ago. And I lost you."
"16","The Monolith","12","6","Renoir","So you leave us no choice? How are you different from her in doing this?"
"16","The Monolith","12","7","Verso","I’m tired."
"16","The Monolith","12","8","Renoir","So trust me. We are your family."
"16","The Monolith","12","9","Verso","Family is… complicated."
"16","The Monolith","12","10","Renoir","If saving you means losing you, then so be it."
"16","The Monolith","12","11","Verso","We only need to incapacitate him."
"16","The Monolith","12","12","Maelle","We’ll find a way to kill him."
"16","The Monolith","13","0","Renoir","Remember who your REAL family is. It’s not her. It’s your sister. Your mother. Me. WE are your family. You would condemn us all to die, for what? Who do you really save with your sacrifice?"
"16","The Monolith","13","1","Maelle","Your sister. And… your mother…"
"16","The Monolith","13","2","Verso","You’re too drunk on your own illusion to understand."
"16","The Monolith","13","3","Renoir","Then let us celebrate the second destruction of the Dessendre family. At long last, we meet. This is all you have left of your son. Destroying it won’t bring your wife back. It will only destroy the last tie you have to each other. I love them too."
"16","The Monolith","13","4","Maelle","We did it, Gustave–"
"16","The Monolith","13","5","Lune","Hey. How did you do that?"
"16","The Monolith","13","6","Maelle","I’m not sure. The Curator– I felt it–"
"16","The Monolith","13","7","Lune","Can you do it again?"
"16","The Monolith","13","8","Maelle","I don’t know– uh. I think so? Yeah, yeah I think I can."
"16","The Monolith","13","9","Sciel","What did Renoir mean? The things he said to the Curator."
"16","The Monolith","13","10","Verso","I’m– I’m not sure."
"16","The Monolith","13","11","Maelle","She’s through there."
"16","The Monolith","13","12","Lune","Yeah. Behind this door is the future of Lumière. What every expedition has worked towards. I have trust… in us."
