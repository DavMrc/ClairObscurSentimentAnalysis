"16","The Monolith","20","0","Alicia","Brother, I tire of the conflicts and deceptions that plague our family and theirs. So I entrust you with this letter. Whether you give it to her is up to you. I’m at peace with what’s to come. When the time comes, I hope you will be too."
"16","The Monolith","21","0","Alicia","Maelle. It’s a strange feeling, watching you with my brother. Laughing and smiling. Without the scars or the memories that afflict me. Alicia – as she was meant to be. Not this painted version that I am. My family, a facsimile of yours. And this world, a mirror. Painted by our mother, the Paintress, to stave off her grief."
"16","The Monolith","22","0","Alicia","Seeing your expedition through would plunge us all into the abyss. For in ridding the world of the Paintress… You’d lose the sole force standing against the one who would erase us. The one who invokes the flowers of the Gommage. An act of love. For he does love her. Your Father."
"16","The Monolith","23","0","Alicia","On her Monolith, she paints a warning for us all. Of the few she can save as her power wanes. We all wish for our families to thrive. Your family, however, believes only one can survive. But perhaps you’ll find another way. You who have lived amongst us. Perhaps you differ from your father and your father, as I differ from mine. Your mother paints life. While your father, death. What will you paint?"
