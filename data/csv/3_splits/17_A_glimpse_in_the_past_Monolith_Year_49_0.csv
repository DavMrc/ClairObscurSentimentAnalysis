"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","0","1","Clea","Alicia?"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","0","2","Alicia","…"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","0","3","Clea","Good, you’re awake. Come downstairs."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","0","Clea","Come along now, I’m in Renoir’s atelier. Alicia, quit dawdling. End of the corridor, you know where it is. Finally. Our little shadow is awake. Our parents are quite the stubborn pair. They’re still fighting each other inside the Canvas. He has her imprisoned at the top of her Monolith and she has him trapped beneath. It’s a stalemate."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","1","Alicia","(I’m worried. They’ve been inside the Canvas for so long.)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","2","Clea","They’ve spent longer than this in other Canvases. It’s not that dire."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","3","Alicia","…"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","4","Clea","Yes, I know. Maman’s been in there for quite a while already. And Renoir is wasting time in there, trying to help someone who doesn’t want his help. We have more urgent matters to attend to."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","5","Alicia","(Did you see… Verso?)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","6","Clea","You’re as bad as Aline. He’s not Verso. He’s a painted copy, built from our mother’s memories. You’d do well to remember that."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","7","Alicia","(I know that, I’m not a child.)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","8","Clea","Don’t roll your eyes at me, sister dear. I know you’re not a child, but you’re not grown either. And too many in our family have lost all caution and sense of late."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","9","Alicia","(Can you help Maman?)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","10","Clea","Help her do what? Run away and hide? She’s already succeeded there. Honestly, if Aline wants to numb herself in the Canvas, then let her."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","11","Alicia","…"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","12","Clea","Grief is no excuse. We’re all grieving. She’s a grown woman and she was the head of the Painter’s Council. She failed her responsibilities. I don’t have time to coddle her. And before Verso died, she would have said the same."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","13","Alicia","(Can you help Papa?)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","14","Clea","I already have. Aline is more skilled than Renoir, but I’ve tipped the scales in his favour. I have my pets in place. “She who controls chromas, controls the Canvas.” I can’t take her chroma, but I can keep it from returning to her."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","15","Alicia","…"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","16","Clea","Yes, it’s enough. It’s just a matter of time. As she weakens, Renoir is able to erase her oldest creations. With the exception of her obscene fake family. She’s made them immortal, but luckily, they’re also quite useless. I need you to take care of yourself while I’m gone."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","17","Alicia","(You’re leaving?)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","18","Clea","Don’t be naive. The world doesn’t stop simply because our family is in mourning. The conflict is spreading and there are things I must do if we Painters are to survive."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","19","Alicia","(I… I want to help.)"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","20","Clea","You will do nothing. You’re too weak to do anything useful, you’d be a liability. The Writers used you against us once before, they won’t hesitate to use you again. And I can’t promise that I’ll make the same choice Verso made. Verso traded his life for yours. I both love and hate him for that. The damn fool. Although… If you really want to be useful, then enter the Canvas and help Renoir. I need him back here sooner rather than later. I’ll fight this war alone if I have to, but I’d really rather not. Can you handle that?"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","21","Alicia","…"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","22","Clea","Lest you forget, the only reason those two are in there is because your naivety cost Verso his life."
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","23","Alicia","…"
"17","A glimpse in the past – Monolith Year 49","1","24","Clea","Good. Go to the Canvas when you’re ready. And repaint your throat when you’re in there, before you completely forget how to have a conversation."
