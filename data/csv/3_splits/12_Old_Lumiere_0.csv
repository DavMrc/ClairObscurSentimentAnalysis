"12","Old Lumière","0","0","Monoco","Welcome, my friends, to Old Lumière."
"12","Old Lumière","0","1","Maelle","Is anyone still here?"
"12","Old Lumière","0","2","Verso","Just Nevrons."
"12","Old Lumière","0","3","Sciel","So this is where our piece of Lumière used to be. Before the Fracture ripped apart the world and threw us into the sea."
"12","Old Lumière","0","4","Lune","We’re lucky it did, that’s probably the only reason we survived."
"12","Old Lumière","0","5","Verso","The heart of the Paintress is in the centre, let’s go."
"12","Old Lumière","1","0","Lune","Hm. We’ll need a way forward."
"12","Old Lumière","1","1","Verso","The heart is in the centre of the city. Alright, show off a bit, Monoco."
"12","Old Lumière","1","2","Monoco","Just admit you can’t do it yourself."
"12","Old Lumière","1","3","Verso","Putain! MONOCO!"
"12","Old Lumière","2","0","Lune","Monoco, why the hell did you-"
"12","Old Lumière","2","1","Monoco","Sorry. I fucked up. I just wanted to show off."
"12","Old Lumière","2","2","Sciel","We just have to regroup, the others should be fine. Verso said the heart is in the centre of Old Lumière, right?"
"12","Old Lumière","2","3","Lune","Right. Okay. Monoco, stop crying, we have to move."
"12","Old Lumière","2","4","Monoco","Yes. Sorry."
"12","Old Lumière","3","0","Sciel","How exactly did our piece of Lumière end up on an island, when the rest of the city is here?"
"12","Old Lumière","3","1","Monoco","One of the great mysteries."
"12","Old Lumière","3","2","Lune","I wish we had more time, there’s so much to study here."
"12","Old Lumière","3","3","Sciel","So, Monoco, what was life like before the Fracture?"
"12","Old Lumière","3","4","Monoco","The world was smaller and cosier. Livelier. There was many more of us Gestrals back then. The Fracture tore our villages apart. Only a fraction of a fraction survived. Our forests are filled with Gestrals awaiting rebirth."
"12","Old Lumière","4","0","Sciel","Doesn’t that look like one of Esquie’s stones?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","1","Lune","Oh, yeah."
"12","Old Lumière","4","2","Sciel","Let’s bring him a gift. I was surprised you agreed so readily to Verso’s plans."
"12","Old Lumière","4","3","Lune","He seems to be our best bet for now. We lack too much information."
"12","Old Lumière","4","4","Sciel","Do you trust him?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","5","Lune","I trust that he wants to reach the Paintress. So for now, our interests are aligned."
"12","Old Lumière","4","6","Sciel","He has been helpful. Still, I have this feeling he’s hiding something."
"12","Old Lumière","4","7","Lune","Monoco, how did you meet Verso?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","8","Monoco","Hm. I don’t really remember. I feel like I’ve always known Verso."
"12","Old Lumière","4","9","Lune","He mentioned travelling with other Expeditions."
"12","Old Lumière","4","10","Monoco","Quite a few."
"12","Old Lumière","4","11","Lune","How many? What happened to them?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","12","Monoco","Hmmm… Hmmm… What happened to them…"
"12","Old Lumière","4","13","Sciel","Maybe ask Verso when we find him."
"12","Old Lumière","4","14","Lune","Yeah, okay. Finding them comes first. Any idea what this is?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","15","Monoco","I’m afraid not. This is my first time here as well."
"12","Old Lumière","4","16","Sciel","58. They were the ones that Verso was travelling with?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","17","Lune","I believe so. They made it surprisingly far. An Axon. Interesting. Verso is… Is this true?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","18","Sciel","Maelle’s with him."
"12","Old Lumière","4","19","Lune","We need to go. NOW."
"12","Old Lumière","4","20","Monoco","Verso would never harm her."
