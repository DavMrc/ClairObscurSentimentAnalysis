"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","0","Verso","Hi. You’re tired of painting, aren’t you? I’m tired too…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","1","Maelle","That’s—Oh. You shouldn’t be able to be here."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","2","Verso","Maman’s gift."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","3","Maelle","Why did you run in? It’s dangerous for you here."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","4","Verso","“See things as they are, not how you want them to be.”"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","5","Maelle","What?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","6","Verso","You lied. To your father."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","7","Maelle","No, I—"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","8","Verso","He saw it too. But he wanted to believe. You’re going to die here. Why don’t you just leave? You can always come back."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","9","Maelle","The moment I leave, Papa will erase this canvas."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","10","Verso","This is not worth your life."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","11","Maelle","What life? My life of loneliness in a shell of a body? With no voice and no future?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","12","Verso","You’re Maelle, no matter where you are. You don’t need this canvas."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","13","Maelle","But everything I want is here. Here I have a chance to live, Verso. To live. Out there, I merely exist."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","14","Verso","“Life keeps forcing cruel choices.”"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","15","Maelle","Stop quoting Papa!"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","16","Verso","It’s time to stop Painting."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","17","Maelle","Verso… Papa also said, “Hold onto each other.”"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","18","Verso","I’m sorry."
