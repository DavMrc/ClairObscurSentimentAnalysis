"12","Old Lumière","0","0","Monoco","Welcome, my friends, to Old Lumière."
"12","Old Lumière","0","1","Maelle","Is anyone still here?"
"12","Old Lumière","0","2","Verso","Just Nevrons."
"12","Old Lumière","0","3","Sciel","So this is where our piece of Lumière used to be. Before the Fracture ripped apart the world and threw us into the sea."
"12","Old Lumière","0","4","Lune","We’re lucky it did, that’s probably the only reason we survived."
"12","Old Lumière","0","5","Verso","The heart of the Paintress is in the centre, let’s go."
"12","Old Lumière","1","0","Lune","Hm. We’ll need a way forward."
"12","Old Lumière","1","1","Verso","The heart is in the centre of the city. Alright, show off a bit, Monoco."
"12","Old Lumière","1","2","Monoco","Just admit you can’t do it yourself."
"12","Old Lumière","1","3","Verso","Putain! MONOCO!"
"12","Old Lumière","2","0","Lune","Monoco, why the hell did you-"
"12","Old Lumière","2","1","Monoco","Sorry. I fucked up. I just wanted to show off."
"12","Old Lumière","2","2","Sciel","We just have to regroup, the others should be fine. Verso said the heart is in the centre of Old Lumière, right?"
"12","Old Lumière","2","3","Lune","Right. Okay. Monoco, stop crying, we have to move."
"12","Old Lumière","2","4","Monoco","Yes. Sorry."
"12","Old Lumière","3","0","Sciel","How exactly did our piece of Lumière end up on an island, when the rest of the city is here?"
"12","Old Lumière","3","1","Monoco","One of the great mysteries."
"12","Old Lumière","3","2","Lune","I wish we had more time, there’s so much to study here."
"12","Old Lumière","3","3","Sciel","So, Monoco, what was life like before the Fracture?"
"12","Old Lumière","3","4","Monoco","The world was smaller and cosier. Livelier. There was many more of us Gestrals back then. The Fracture tore our villages apart. Only a fraction of a fraction survived. Our forests are filled with Gestrals awaiting rebirth."
"12","Old Lumière","4","0","Sciel","Doesn’t that look like one of Esquie’s stones?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","1","Lune","Oh, yeah."
"12","Old Lumière","4","2","Sciel","Let’s bring him a gift. I was surprised you agreed so readily to Verso’s plans."
"12","Old Lumière","4","3","Lune","He seems to be our best bet for now. We lack too much information."
"12","Old Lumière","4","4","Sciel","Do you trust him?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","5","Lune","I trust that he wants to reach the Paintress. So for now, our interests are aligned."
"12","Old Lumière","4","6","Sciel","He has been helpful. Still, I have this feeling he’s hiding something."
"12","Old Lumière","4","7","Lune","Monoco, how did you meet Verso?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","8","Monoco","Hm. I don’t really remember. I feel like I’ve always known Verso."
"12","Old Lumière","4","9","Lune","He mentioned travelling with other Expeditions."
"12","Old Lumière","4","10","Monoco","Quite a few."
"12","Old Lumière","4","11","Lune","How many? What happened to them?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","12","Monoco","Hmmm… Hmmm… What happened to them…"
"12","Old Lumière","4","13","Sciel","Maybe ask Verso when we find him."
"12","Old Lumière","4","14","Lune","Yeah, okay. Finding them comes first. Any idea what this is?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","15","Monoco","I’m afraid not. This is my first time here as well."
"12","Old Lumière","4","16","Sciel","58. They were the ones that Verso was travelling with?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","17","Lune","I believe so. They made it surprisingly far. An Axon. Interesting. Verso is… Is this true?"
"12","Old Lumière","4","18","Sciel","Maelle’s with him."
"12","Old Lumière","4","19","Lune","We need to go. NOW."
"12","Old Lumière","4","20","Monoco","Verso would never harm her."
"12","Old Lumière","5","0","Verso","Can you stand? Monoco gets a bit carried away sometimes."
"12","Old Lumière","5","1","Maelle","My back hurts, but I’m fine."
"12","Old Lumière","5","2","Verso","Good. The others are probably heading toward the centre of the city. We’ll rejoin them there."
"12","Old Lumière","5","3","Noco","And find treasure along the way!"
"12","Old Lumière","5","4","Maelle","Feels like home."
"12","Old Lumière","5","5","Verso","yeah, feels like home. You ok?"
"12","Old Lumière","5","6","Maelle","Monoco fits well in the Disaster Expedition, eh?"
"12","Old Lumière","5","7","Verso","Yeah, he does. After you."
"12","Old Lumière","6","0","Maelle","Speaking of home, where’d you live in Lumière?"
"12","Old Lumière","6","1","Verso","Above a bakery near the centre. Um… Angelique’s Boulangerie! I ate there every morning. I wonder if it’s still there."
"12","Old Lumière","6","2","Maelle","It’s called “Mathilde”s” now. When this is over, you should go and visit."
"12","Old Lumière","7","0","Noco","Verso, where’s the treasure??"
"12","Old Lumière","7","1","Verso","I never said there was treasure."
"12","Old Lumière","7","2","Noco","Wait a minute…!"
"12","Old Lumière","8","0","Maelle","We’re a pretty good team. Verso? VERSO? Putain. What- Where did he go? Verso, where did you go… I need to find Lune and Sciel. Quickly."
"12","Old Lumière","8","1","Noco","Hihihi. I’m still here! Don’t worry, Verso runs off all the time. He’s always ditching me and Monoco. He’ll be back."
"12","Old Lumière","8","2","Maelle","I think I’m close."
"12","Old Lumière","8","3","Noco","Oh, oh, over there! That must be the place."
"12","Old Lumière","8","4","Maelle","This manor’s intact… Why does it feel so familiar… I… know this place…"
"12","Old Lumière","9","0","Verso","I knew you’d open the door for her. Merde."
"12","Old Lumière","9","1","Renoir","Really, Verso? This was your plan? How many times must you hurt our family."
"12","Old Lumière","9","2","Verso","No. No, you don’t get to lecture ME on family."
"12","Old Lumière","9","3","Renoir","Why do you refuse to see I am doing this for us? Yet you insist on rushing toward death. You’re trying to stop the wrong cycle."
"12","Old Lumière","9","4","Verso","You’re doing this for yourself."
"12","Old Lumière","9","5","Renoir","Of course, it’s easier for you to think that, isn’t it? Easier to betray us, if I’m the villain."
"12","Old Lumière","9","6","Maelle","Verso, move. I’m gonna fucking kill him."
"12","Old Lumière","9","7","Renoir","You haven’t told her the truth, have you, son?"
"12","Old Lumière","9","8","Lune","Sorry, we’re late, we were busy doing a bit of reading. Were you planning on sharing that this man, the man who murdered our team, is your father?"
"12","Old Lumière","9","9","Verso","Family is not my favourite topic. right, can we talk about this later? I’d really like for you all to survive this."
"12","Old Lumière","9","10","Renoir","You forced us to this point. You’re tearing your family apart."
"12","Old Lumière","10","0","Verso","Everyone all right? Monoco?"
"12","Old Lumière","10","1","Monoco","Noco’s- broken."
"12","Old Lumière","10","2","Renoir","Why can’t you accept who you are?"
"12","Old Lumière","10","3","Verso","ALICIA, MOVE!"
"12","Old Lumière","10","4","Maelle","What is tha- Will you… Tell me your name?"
"12","Old Lumière","10","5","Verso","Putain! Where did it go? No, no, no, no. Alicia! Fuck! (angry roar)"
"12","Old Lumière","11","0","Esquie","Oooooh Dorrie! Thank you, mon amie!"
"12","Old Lumière","11","1","Lune","Care to explain? Your father?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","2","Verso","I don’t think of him as my father anymore."
"12","Old Lumière","11","3","Sciel","Still. Why didn’t you just tell us?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","4","Verso","Because it’s private and it’s painful. And it’s none of your business. I cut ties with him decades ago."
"12","Old Lumière","11","5","Lune","Lying by omission is still lying."
"12","Old Lumière","11","6","Verso","I’ve told you everything you need to know-"
"12","Old Lumière","11","7","Lune","I’d rather make that determination for myself."
"12","Old Lumière","11","8","Sciel","I think we can all understand where each other’s wyoming from. Right? He hasn’t steered us wrong yet. But we’re a team now. And we won’t get very far if we don’t trust each other."
"12","Old Lumière","11","9","Maelle","Family- is complicated."
"12","Old Lumière","11","10","Lune","The stories say that Gestrals reincarnate? Is that true? Can you bring Noco back?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","11","Monoco","Partially. We can bring Noco back to life, but not all of Noco will return. It will be- a different Noco. The one you knew is gone."
"12","Old Lumière","11","12","Verso","I’m- I am so very sorry, my friend. And all… all for naught. The Paintress’ heart was in that manor and now it’s gone. We have no way to access the Monolith."
"12","Old Lumière","11","13","Lune","Expedition 58 seemed to think you knew another way."
"12","Old Lumière","11","14","Verso","What?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","15","Lune","We found 58 and their journals."
"12","Old Lumière","11","16","Verso","So that’s how you- I wasn’t hiding it, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s a dead end."
"12","Old Lumière","11","17","Maelle","Wait, what’re you talking about?"
"12","Old Lumière","11","18","Lune","There is someone else who can help us."
"12","Old Lumière","12","0","Lune","Excuse me. Is it true? Can you make a weapon that can pierce the barrier? Do you need something from the Axons?"
"12","Old Lumière","12","1","The Curator","Axons. Axons."
"12","Old Lumière","12","2","Lune","Do you need… their hearts?"
"12","Old Lumière","12","3","Verso","Look. To create this weapon, he needs enormous amounts of pure chroma. Which is way beyond what we can get from Nevrons. The only source are Axons, but like I said, that’s a dead end, it’s impossible."
"12","Old Lumière","12","4","Maelle","What? What are Axons?"
"12","Old Lumière","12","5","Verso","They’re massive creatures living on islands around the Monolith. They’re much stronger and MUCH, MUCH more dangerous than Nevrons. I can’t die and I still couldn’t take them down."
"12","Old Lumière","12","6","Lune","Yet we found the corpse of one in Old Lumière. So it’s possible."
"12","Old Lumière","12","7","Verso","I don’t know how that one die, but I’m telling you, listen to me, please, our chances of taking them down without you lot dying are close to zero."
"12","Old Lumière","12","8","Lune","Close, but not zero. Death is coming either way. And as Expeditioners, if we die, we die fighting."
"12","Old Lumière","12","9","Monoco","Wonderful pep talk."
"12","Old Lumière","12","10","Lune","I know."
"12","Old Lumière","13","0","Verso","Alright, if – IF – we’re going to fight the Axons, then let’s be smart about it."
"12","Old Lumière","13","1","Sciel","What d’you mean?"
"12","Old Lumière","13","2","Verso","I’ve had a few rough encounters with the Axons. There are three located on islands around the Monolith. and we need at least two hearts to get enough chroma. One lives on a mountain, too high for us to reach, so that one’s out. We should start with the one to the west of the Monolith. It’s already been weakened by previous Expeditions, alright?"
"12","Old Lumière","13","3","Lune","Yeah, good idea. Maximise our chances."
"12","Old Lumière","13","4","Sciel","Or we embrace the challenge and pick the one in the east!"
"12","Old Lumière","13","5","Monoco","Mmmmm, I like your spirit."
"12","Old Lumière","13","6","Sciel","Thank you."
"12","Old Lumière","13","7","Verso","Did you listen to what I just said?"
"12","Old Lumière","14","0","Sciel","All these years and you never defeated an Axon?"
"12","Old Lumière","14","1","Verso","They’re kind of tough."
"12","Old Lumière","14","2","Sciel","And you think our chances are close to zero?"
"12","Old Lumière","14","3","Verso","I didn’t think you cared about odds."
"12","Old Lumière","14","4","Sciel","Lune and I have less than a year. But Maelle’s different."
"12","Old Lumière","14","5","Verso","Hmm."
"12","Old Lumière","15","0","Verso","I’m sorry, mon vieux. We’ll bring Noco back."
"12","Old Lumière","15","1","Monoco","I know."
"12","Old Lumière","15","2","Verso","I’m ready, just say the word."
"12","Old Lumière","15","3","Monoco","When the time is right. After we’ve settled this."
"12","Old Lumière","16","0","Verso","Lune…"
"12","Old Lumière","16","1","Lune","Mm."
"12","Old Lumière","16","2","Verso","Okay, we’ll talk later then."
"12","Old Lumière","17","0","Verso","Ready for the Axons?"
"12","Old Lumière","17","1","Maelle","…"
"12","Old Lumière","17","2","Verso","Course you are."
"12","Old Lumière","18","0","Esquie","I’m mad."
"12","Old Lumière","18","1","Verso","Esquie?"
"12","Old Lumière","18","2","Esquie","I’m stinking mad."
"12","Old Lumière","18","3","Verso","About Noco?"
"12","Old Lumière","18","4","Esquie","That was MEAN. I thought he cared! Renoir’s not being Renoir!"
"12","Old Lumière","18","5","Verso","He’s not- (exhale) I know, buddy. I’m mad too."
"12","Old Lumière","19","0","narrator","Maelle finds a spot where she can write. She spends some time writing in Gustave’s journal, to honour his memory. She writes about Old Lumière and how their city was actually transported from the continent to the ocean. She hopes Gustave’s apprentices will read this journal someday."
"12","Old Lumière","20","0","Maelle","So the masked person with Renoir, that’s your sister?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","1","Verso","…"
"12","Old Lumière","20","2","Maelle","Not a hard leap to make."
"12","Old Lumière","20","3","Verso","Her name’s Alicia."
"12","Old Lumière","20","4","Maelle","What’s wrong with her? She wears a mask all the time, she never talks, and she’s always staring."
"12","Old Lumière","20","5","Verso","She, uh- She was trapped in a fire. A long time ago. Damaged her face and her throat, so, up- Yeah."
"12","Old Lumière","20","6","Maelle","Huh. Why… did they come to see me?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","7","Verso","I don’t know. That surprised me, when you told me. She helped me before, I thought she’d help me again. But it seems she’s chosen a different side. “Family is complicated,” right?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","8","Maelle","Mm. Yeah."
"12","Old Lumière","20","9","Verso","Do you want the armband back?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","10","Maelle","What?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","11","Verso","I feel like a fraud, wearing it. Given, you know…"
"12","Old Lumière","20","12","Maelle","Wear it anyway. You said you chose your side, right?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","13","Verso","I did. You’re not upset with me?"
"12","Old Lumière","20","14","Maelle","Strangely, no. I hate secrets, but… Gustave always gave people the benefit of the doubt. And your actions are what matters. I trust you."
"12","Old Lumière","20","15","Verso","Thanks."
