"0","The Gommage","0","0","Maelle","If you’re gonna give someone flowers, you should probably do it BEFORE they wither and die."
"0","The Gommage","0","1","Gustave","What, the flower? Or Sophie?"
"0","The Gommage","0","2","Maelle","Ooh, dark. Sophie would approve. Hey, you said it, not me. The others are waiting for you, you’re supposed to be helping with the festival."
"0","The Gommage","0","3","Gustave","With what? Putting three tables? They’ll manage."
"0","The Gommage","0","4","Maelle","Ah. You underestimate Lumière’s enthusiasm for the Expedition. There’s at least FIVE tables."
"0","The Gommage","0","5","Gustave","Marvellous."
"0","The Gommage","0","6","Maelle","Have you tried throwing with your other arm instead? If you could hit the Paintress directly, that would actually be useful."
"0","The Gommage","0","7","Gustave","You know, hobbies don’t always have to be useful. I’m enjoying the uselessness of today, and readying my usefulness for tomorrow. And soon, we’ll get to do a lot more than throw rocks."
"0","The Gommage","0","8","Maelle","That’s what all the other expeditions said too."
"0","The Gommage","0","9","Gustave","Heyheyhey. You know, you know they gave their lives to lay the trail for us, right?"
"0","The Gommage","0","10","Maelle","Yeah, I know, sorry."
"0","The Gommage","0","11","Gustave","Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","0","12","Maelle","You still got a flower to give, no?"
"0","The Gommage","0","13","Gustave","Yes, yes. It’s just… I’m not sure how to start. After four years apart, what do I say to her, on the day of her Gommage."
"0","The Gommage","0","14","Maelle","You’re asking ME? I dunno, sun’s about to set, so… be direct? “Hey Soph-been a while. Could we–”"
"0","The Gommage","1","0","Maelle","All right, let’s go. I’ll accompany you there. Are you… ready to see her again?"
"0","The Gommage","1","1","Gustave","Yeah, been ready."
"0","The Gommage","1","2","Maelle","I set up these grapple shortcuts. Nice, huh? Don’t tell your sister, though. I sort of “borrowed” the hooks from the Expedition Academy. Wish I had them when I was working as a courier… Come on, Gustave, speed up a bit. Sophie will have already gommaged by the time you’ve arrived."
"0","The Gommage","1","3","Gustave","Maelle."
"0","The Gommage","1","4","Maelle","I can’t believe Sophie already turned 33… She looks so much younger than you."
"0","The Gommage","1","5","Gustave","Thanks."
"0","The Gommage","1","6","Maelle","She’s popular, I’m sure she already has a necklace full of flowers."
"0","The Gommage","1","7","Gustave","Hm. I can imagine."
"0","The Gommage","1","8","Maelle","Hmm…"
"0","The Gommage","1","9","Gustave","What?"
"0","The Gommage","1","10","Maelle","You look tense."
"0","The Gommage","1","11","Gustave","Yeah, I, hum… Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","1","12","Maelle","I know what you need! A little duel!"
"0","The Gommage","1","13","Gustave","No."
"0","The Gommage","1","14","Maelle","Come on, it’ll loosen you up. You can’t go and see Sophie all sombre and tense."
"0","The Gommage","1","15","Gustave","Hmmm…"
"0","The Gommage","1","16","Maelle","And… if you win, I’ll give you something you can use with your Lumina Converter."
"0","The Gommage","1","17","Gustave","Alright, you’re on."
"0","The Gommage","1","18","Maelle","Yes!"
"0","The Gommage","2","0","Maelle","You won! Now, don’t you feel better? I see your smile. All right, now let’s go find Sophie. I saw her near the red and white tree."
"0","The Gommage","2","1","Gustave","Yeah."
"0","The Gommage","2","2","Maelle","Oh, the Plaza is lively. Why people like to celebrate the Gommage is still a mystery to me, but, oh, well. The red and white tree… I’ve always found it beautiful. I don’t really understand. You and Sophie broke up so long ago. But clearly, you never got over her. Why’d you wait until today to say something? It’s a bit late, isn’t it? Sophie is down there."
"0","The Gommage","2","3","Gustave","Yeah, I know."
"0","The Gommage","2","4","Maelle","I… Good luck. I’ll be here for you if things… don’t go as planned."
"0","The Gommage","2","5","Gustave","Thanks."
"0","The Gommage","2","6","Maelle","Come on, she’s down there. It’s your moment."
"0","The Gommage","3","0","Sophie","…the last few days meant everything."
"0","The Gommage","3","1","Gustave","…Could we talk?"
"0","The Gommage","3","2","Sophie","Gustave. I love you all."
"0","The Gommage","3","3","Gustave","For your, um– If there’s room…"
"0","The Gommage","3","4","Sophie","There’s always room."
"0","The Gommage","3","5","Gustave","You know, I’m sorry that…"
"0","The Gommage","3","6","Sophie","I missed you–"
"0","The Gommage","3","7","Gustave","I missed you too."
"0","The Gommage","3","8","Sophie","You don’t need to– (laugh) Okay."
"0","The Gommage","3","9","Gustave","You go."
"0","The Gommage","3","10","Sophie","No, you."
"0","The Gommage","3","11","Gustave","You, uh– You know how I fell. I– I wish things had been– You know… I often think– Another path, you know… Another future–"
"0","The Gommage","3","12","Sophie","Still can’t finish your sentences, can you?"
"0","The Gommage","3","13","Gustave","Yeah, that hasn’t changed…"
"0","The Gommage","3","14","Sophie","I missed that. I never faulted you for wanting to believe. You’re fighting. To change things. I understand, I just… In a “different world”, right?"
"0","The Gommage","3","15","Gustave","We’ll break the cycle. So She can’t steal anyone else’s future."
"0","The Gommage","3","16","Sophie","Stubborn people change the world. And you are the most stubborn person I know. Thank you. Walk me to the harbour?"
"0","The Gommage","3","17","Gustave","Yes."
"0","The Gommage","4","0","Tiffanie","Oh, hi, Sophie. So Gustave really did come, huh?"
"0","The Gommage","4","1","Sophie","Hm, yeah, he did."
"0","The Gommage","4","2","Tiffanie","I knew he would."
"0","The Gommage","4","3","Sophie","Shh, he might hear us."
"0","The Gommage","4","4","Tiffanie","You’re a lucky one, you know."
"0","The Gommage","4","5","Sophie","I know that…"
"0","The Gommage","4","6","Tiffanie","But he is too."
"0","The Gommage","4","7","Sophie","Looks like you still have a lot of flowers left."
"0","The Gommage","4","8","Tiffanie","Well, there are less and less people to buy them… I just wish you didn’t have to wear one."
"0","The Gommage","4","9","Sophie","Tiffanie…"
"0","The Gommage","4","10","Tiffanie","I should finish cleaning up here and join everyone at the harbour. See you."
"0","The Gommage","4","11","Sophie","See you…"
"0","The Gommage","5","0","Gustave","I can’t imagine what you’re going through…"
"0","The Gommage","5","1","Sophie","I’m fine."
"0","The Gommage","5","2","Gustave","(sceptical grunt)"
"0","The Gommage","5","3","Sophie","I’m FINE. I’ve lived 33 good years. Look around. We’ve had our whole lives to prepare. We’re all fine. Mostly."
"0","The Gommage","5","4","Gustave","I’m not fine."
"0","The Gommage","5","5","Sophie","You will be."
"0","The Gommage","6","0","narrator","People have gathered here, on their way to the harbour. Reuniting… one last time…"
"0","The Gommage","7","0","Marie","Oh… Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","7","1","Sophie","Marie…"
"0","The Gommage","7","2","Marie","Your flowers… I didn’t know about… I thought you were younger. And yet you didn’t have children…"
"0","The Gommage","7","3","Sophie","I’m not having this conversation with you again. Not today."
"0","The Gommage","7","4","Marie","Do you care so little about the future of Lumière? How can you be so selfish?"
"0","The Gommage","7","5","Sophie","I’m not selfish enough to bring others into our doomed world. I know we are not many to think like this now… And it destroyed my relationship with the person I loved the most. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to spend this moment with him. And you should cherish this moment with your daughter."
"0","The Gommage","7","6","Marie","… Sorry… See you at the harbour."
"0","The Gommage","7","7","Sophie","Good luck, Marie."
"0","The Gommage","8","0","Cyril","Ah, the scintillating Sophie! You’re as gorgeous as always!"
"0","The Gommage","8","1","Sophie","Cyril, you flatterer. Need some help with your writing again?"
"0","The Gommage","8","2","Cyril","Beautiful and perceptive, per usual. See, I’m preparing the headline for tomorrow, and who could write it better than someone who celebrates her special day today!"
"0","The Gommage","8","3","Sophie","Hm, true. So, what will the article be about?"
"0","The Gommage","8","4","Cyril","Actually…"
"0","The Gommage","8","5","Sophie","You don’t know?"
"0","The Gommage","8","6","Cyril","Well…"
"0","The Gommage","8","7","Sophie","You really are lazy."
"0","The Gommage","8","8","Cyril","Help me again, Sophie, please. My boss will kill me…"
"0","The Gommage","8","9","Sophie","Sure, let me think of a headline…"
"0","The Gommage","8","10","Sophie","Expedition 33 shall be the destined journey."
"0","The Gommage","8","11","Cyril","A headline about the Expedition… That’s bold. Nobody really cares about them anymore after their constant failures. But that would make a wonderful underdog story. Okay, now I’m inspired. You really are a divine being, Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","8","12","Sophie","Don’t forget to credit me."
"0","The Gommage","8","13","Cyril","I would never… Thank you for all these times."
"0","The Gommage","8","14","Sophie","It’s always been a pleasure, my friend. Take care of yourself."
"0","The Gommage","8","15","Cyril","Yeah…"
"0","The Gommage","9","0","Estelle","Hey, you. You seem like a woman with exquisite taste. I just finished my sculpture to the legendary Esquie. This may be my life’s finest work, yet not a single soul seems to care. How could I make it better?"
"0","The Gommage","9","1","Sophie","Perhaps you could paint it? Add some colours?"
"0","The Gommage","9","2","Estelle","Paint it? Hmm… Brilliant. I knew you were the right person to ask. Thank you for your insight!"
"0","The Gommage","9","3","Sophie","You’re most welcome."
"0","The Gommage","9","4","Estelle","I shall get to work tomorrow. I see you’re wearing flowers. What’s your name?"
"0","The Gommage","9","5","Sophie","Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","9","6","Estelle","Sophie, as a thank you, I shall chisel your name onto the statue."
"0","The Gommage","9","7","Sophie","Oh, you don’t have to."
"0","The Gommage","9","8","Estelle","But I will."
"0","The Gommage","10","0","narrator","People who are about to Gommage leave their furniture. So the others may use them."
"0","The Gommage","11","0","Sophie","(examine)"
"0","The Gommage","12","0","narrator","Sophie and Gustave examine the stuff left behind."
"0","The Gommage","13","0","Gustave","We can use that."
"0","The Gommage","14","0","narrator","The rest is better left for future generations."
"0","The Gommage","15","0","Ulysse","My Gestral costume is the best! Hey, madame, do you think the Gestrals really exist?"
"0","The Gommage","15","1","Sophie","Of course they do!"
"0","The Gommage","15","2","Ulysse","That’s what I think too. The others laugh, but I know they’re real. One day, I will meet one. Even if it means joining an Expedition! I’ll raise a Gestral army and we’ll crush the Paintress! And me and my little brother will live with the Gestrals and they’ll be our new family. We’re tired of the orphanage… If the legends are true, they really like to fight. That’s why I’m training everyday by beating up my little brother!"
"0","The Gommage","15","3","Sophie","That’s… Yeah. You would make a great Gestral."
"0","The Gommage","15","4","Ulysse","Thanks!"
"0","The Gommage","16","0","Richard","Oh, Sophie, what a lovely smell."
"0","The Gommage","16","1","Sophie","Thank you, Richard."
"0","The Gommage","16","2","Richard","I could recognize it from miles away. It’s good you’re here, Sophie. I have a favor to ask of you."
"0","The Gommage","16","3","Sophie","Anything for my beloved sewing teacher."
"0","The Gommage","16","4","Richard","I… We are of the same cohort. Today is my Gommage. And… My son and I had a fight last night. He said he wants to join the Expedition… He wants to waste the last years of his life. I… I didn’t want that for him. I used to think it was a bad choice, but today, I no longer do. I know I made a mistake. I tried to impose my views on him when he is much braver than I will ever be. So I sewed a special uniforme for him as my last gift. Could you bring it to him?"
"0","The Gommage","16","5","Sophie","Of course. I’ll bring it to Jules."
"0","The Gommage","16","6","Richard","He won’t join the Gommage ceremony, but he will be at the Expedition Festival tonight for sure. Oh, but you…"
"0","The Gommage","16","7","Sophie","Don’t worry, I’ll ask Gustave."
"0","The Gommage","16","8","Richard","Gustave? Are you back together?"
"0","The Gommage","16","9","Sophie","For this moment… Maybe."
"0","The Gommage","16","10","Richard","I’m glad… He is a good person."
"0","The Gommage","16","11","Sophie","Yes, he is…"
"0","The Gommage","16","12","Richard","Thanks to both of you. And see you."
"0","The Gommage","16","13","Sophie","See you."
"0","The Gommage","17","0","Eloise","Hm…"
"0","The Gommage","17","1","Sophie","Is something wrong?"
"0","The Gommage","17","2","Eloise","The Expeditions… What a joke."
"0","The Gommage","17","3","Sophie","…"
"0","The Gommage","17","4","Eloise","All they do is leave us here to die. They’re just escaping."
"0","The Gommage","17","5","Sophie","You know their goal is to save us all, right?"
"0","The Gommage","17","6","Eloise","Yeah, that’s what my father told me last year. Before he left for Expedition 34. And here we are again this year. We could have spent one more year together instead of wasting it away…"
"0","The Gommage","17","7","Sophie","Your father fought to offer you a better future…"
"0","The Gommage","17","8","Eloise","I have no future. I know it and I’ve accepted it. We’re doomed."
"0","The Gommage","17","9","Sophie","You never know, this Expedition might be different. There are some special people in this one."
"0","The Gommage","17","10","Eloise","Yeah, right…"
"0","The Gommage","17","11","Sophie","Gustave? Why don’t you show her some of your fighting skills to prove her wrong?"
"0","The Gommage","17","12","Eloise","That’s… This guy is strong…"
"0","The Gommage","17","13","Sophie","They all train their Pictos skills very hard to save us all. And so did your father."
"0","The Gommage","17","14","Eloise","Then, madam, why didn’t you join?"
"0","The Gommage","17","15","Sophie","Me? I’m content with my life. I know what I can and cannot change. Or maybe… Because I was afraid."
"0","The Gommage","17","16","Eloise","… Do you think… I should join the Expedition?"
"0","The Gommage","17","17","Sophie","My friend Sciel always says, do your best, either it works or it doesn’t. Live your life as you want."
"0","The Gommage","17","18","Eloise","I… I don’t want to have regrets… I don’t have that much time…"
"0","The Gommage","17","19","Sophie","When the time comes, you’ll make the right decision. I’m sure."
"0","The Gommage","17","20","Eloise","Thank you. Now I think I know… Give this to your boyfriend, my father gave it to me, but it might be more useful for him."
"0","The Gommage","18","0","narrator","They are trying to recruit for future Expeditions. The number of people volunteering is going down every year…"
"0","The Gommage","19","0","Raphaël","Why does Manon keep saying “death comes to us all?”"
"0","The Gommage","19","1","Gustave","You haven’t heard that before?"
"0","The Gommage","19","2","Raphaël","No?"
"0","The Gommage","19","3","Gustave","Unofficial Expedition motto. You never heard Lucien say it either? It’s one of his favourites."
"0","The Gommage","19","4","Raphaël","I think he prefers “We’re already dead. You’re just catching up.”"
"0","The Gommage","19","5","Gustave","Yeah, I’ve heard that one recently."
"0","The Gommage","19","6","Raphaël","I dunno, kinda nice in a way, having a “deadline.” Forces you to prioritise. It’s a bit freeing as we get closer to the end."
"0","The Gommage","19","7","Gustave","You can really find the silver lining in everything, can’t you?"
"0","The Gommage","19","8","Raphaël","No, it’s just– Things don’t always work out the way we want. No use getting upset, ya know? Use what we can. Leave what we can’t."
"0","The Gommage","19","9","Gustave","Hmm…"
"0","The Gommage","20","0","narrator","The Flower market. People are buying flowers for their loved ones, before they Gommage."
"0","The Gommage","21","0","Ophélie","Hi, Gustave. You’re back. Did you want to pick out a different flower?"
"0","The Gommage","21","1","Gustave","No, the one you suggested earlier was perfect."
"0","The Gommage","21","2","Ophélie","I’m glad. These garlands are our last farewell. I want them all to feel special. I have a garland saved for you, too. But it’s not a farewell garland. It will be a welcome home garland. Good luck… My friend."
"0","The Gommage","21","3","Gustave","Thanks, Ophélie."
"0","The Gommage","22","0","Sophie","Oh, Lune’s playing. You two would make a cute couple."
"0","The Gommage","22","1","Gustave","If you say so."
"0","The Gommage","22","2","Sophie","Or maybe… Something already happened, huh?"
"0","The Gommage","22","3","Gustave","…"
"0","The Gommage","23","0","Maxime","You really think you’re doing something, eh? Out there?"
"0","The Gommage","23","1","Gustave","Maxime. You’re drunk."
"0","The Gommage","23","2","Maxime","None of you ever come back. You go and you take our resources and you waste it all. On a fucked up hero adrenaline fantasy. And still, SHE kills us."
"0","The Gommage","23","3","Gustave","You should go home. Where’s your daughter?"
"0","The Gommage","23","4","Maxime","Where do you THINK? Mourning her mother. On the ANNIVERSARY of her death. Of all their deaths."
"0","The Gommage","23","5","Gustave","Then maybe you should be with her."
"0","The Gommage","23","6","Maxime","I can’t. I can’t look at her. She’s just another reminder that nothing we do matters. Nothing. We hope and we “persevere” and still they die. They all die and we can’t stop it. We can’t save them. We bring another generation into this world just so they can watch us die before they’re even old enough to understand why."
"0","The Gommage","23","7","Gustave","That’s why we’re going. We CAN save them. With our Lumina tech, the Paintress–"
"0","The Gommage","23","8","Maxime","THE PAINTRESS. What, what’s a scrawny shit like YOU gonna do to THE PAINTRESS. Eh? “We’re already dead. You’re just catching up.”"
"0","The Gommage","23","9","Gustave","Maxime."
"0","The Gommage","23","10","Maxime","Forget it. “Bon voyage.”"
"0","The Gommage","24","0","narrator","A perfectly normal trash can. It is indeed a perfectly normal trash can. Nothing special to see here, just a trash can. Once again, a perfectly normal–"
"0","The Gommage","25","0","Trash-can Man","Hey you! You’ve been here for quite a while now! Can you leave? I don’t want to draw attention to myself. I turned 33 today, can you believe my luck? Why would my parents choose the worst time… But I have a strategy. If I hide inside here, the Paintress won’t think of Gommaging me. I’ve been hiding for six months now. So leave and don’t tell anyone I’m here! Ow! What’s that? It’s hurting my ass. Maybe you can use it? Move on, the Paintress must not know I’m here."
"0","The Gommage","26","0","Nicolas","Hm… This lady truly is exquisite."
"0","The Gommage","26","1","Sophie","In love?"
"0","The Gommage","26","2","Nicolas","Not quite. I am only in love with her art. My inspiration has been quite lacking recently. Nobody buys paintings anymore… Just because she is called The Paintress doesn’t mean painting is evil."
"0","The Gommage","26","3","Sophie","Your canvas seems quite empty."
"0","The Gommage","26","4","Nicolas","I need inspiration… But you… I can see you’re in love. With this fine gentleman, I suppose."
"0","The Gommage","26","5","Sophie","We broke up."
"0","The Gommage","26","6","Nicolas","That is of no consequence in the matters of love. But it is this passion I so fiercely desire in my painting. I know, how about showing me a dance of love and sorrow? I am also the official painter of the Opera. Will you help me? If you inspire me, you may become the main painting of Lumière’s Opera."
"0","The Gommage","26","7","Sophie","Yes."
"0","The Gommage","26","8","Nicolas","Fantastic. You may start. Here, gorgeous lady, take this paintbrush and show me your wrath."
"0","The Gommage","26","9","Sophie","Okay, I guess."
"0","The Gommage","26","10","Nicolas","Come on! Dodge your lady’s beautiful moves! That was splendid. One more time. Sublime! One last time! That was splendid! Splendid! I was so enthralled that I completed the painting in an instant."
"0","The Gommage","26","11","Sophie","It’s nice… to know something of us will remain in the world after today. Thank you."
"0","The Gommage","26","12","Nicolas","It is I who should thank you. It was a moving dance. I will propose it for the new Opera painting we have to do this year."
"0","The Gommage","26","13","Sophie","I feel it wasn’t that impressive, but… okay."
"0","The Gommage","26","14","Nicolas","Love will always be impressive. Also, take this as a gesture of appreciation. I see your “not boyfriend” is an Expeditioner. It may prove useful."
"0","The Gommage","27","0","Sophie","Sometimes I feel sorry for her."
"0","The Gommage","27","1","Gustave","Who, the– The Paintress??"
"0","The Gommage","27","2","Sophie","Look at her. She looks… sad. Maybe she’s a prisoner too. Stuck in the same cycle with us. Silly, huh?"
"0","The Gommage","27","3","Gustave","Only you could choose empathy at a moment like this."
"0","The Gommage","27","4","Sophie","It’s one of the few choices I can make."
"0","The Gommage","27","5","Gustave","I couldn’t do it."
"0","The Gommage","27","6","Sophie","It’s ok. You don’t have to."
"0","The Gommage","28","0","narrator","The Gommage is starting soon. Like every year, everyone is gathering at the harbour. Waiting for her to paint a new number."
"0","The Gommage","29","0","Mielle","Oh, hi, Sophie."
"0","The Gommage","29","1","Sophie","Oh? Mielle? I didn’t expect to see you here."
"0","The Gommage","29","2","Mielle","I’m volunteering to help guide children who are losing their parents to the orphanage. Those who were not registered for foster families…"
"0","The Gommage","29","3","Sophie","How kind of you."
"0","The Gommage","29","4","Mielle","I guess I can relate…"
"0","The Gommage","29","5","Sophie","Take care during the Expedition. Gustave told me a lot of wonderful things about you."
"0","The Gommage","29","6","Mielle","About you too. I always told him you two should never have broken up."
"0","The Gommage","29","7","Sophie","Look at these orphans, that’s… That’s where we disagreed. But I have hope that you and Gustave will change things, so no one has to go through this impossible choice again."
"0","The Gommage","29","8","Mielle","Yeah… Let’s hope we will."
"0","The Gommage","29","9","Sophie","See you."
"0","The Gommage","29","10","Mielle","In the next life."
"0","The Gommage","30","0","Florian","The Paintress is going to punish you! You blasphemers. The Gommage is our fault! We brought this upon ourselves. Because we dared to defy her!"
"0","The Gommage","30","1","Gustave","Another one of these Paintress worshippers. Best to ignore him."
"0","The Gommage","31","0","narrator","A weird mime is standing here."
"0","The Gommage","32","0","Sophie","Uh, hello?"
"0","The Gommage","33","0","narrator","The mime reacts. It attacks!"
"0","The Gommage","34","0","Sophie","Gustave, help! That’s… That was close. Thanks, Gustave. Did someone build this? There is something on its body."
"0","The Gommage","35","0","narrator","Gustave destroyed the weird mime."
"0","The Gommage","36","0","Henri","You’d have to be crazy to use Pictos on your own body."
"0","The Gommage","36","1","Sophie","Why? Aren’t you enjoying the show?"
"0","The Gommage","36","2","Henri","Nah, the show’s great, but etching chroma onto your skin? oof, that’s brutal. And just for a dance? I’ll stick to painting Pictos on my machines, I’m not cuckoo enough to put them on my body."
"0","The Gommage","36","3","Sophie","Could be useful though, the Expeditions rely on them quite heavily."
"0","The Gommage","36","4","Henri","Eh, they’re crazy too. But at least, you can remove Pictos pretty easily if you change your mind."
"0","The Gommage","37","0","narrator","People have gathered for the Gommage. The Paintress will soon wake."
"0","The Gommage","38","0","Victor","Mate, I wish I was going with ya! If we could just send a bigger force. Get ALL of Lumière to just throw EVERYTHING we got at the bloody Paintress. Ahhh, but my brother would kill me. His number’s up soon, and I’m guardian for his kid."
"0","The Gommage","38","1","Gustave","Uncle Victor. Suits you."
"0","The Gommage","38","2","Victor","But Maelle! Quite the ballsy one, eh? No looking back for her. Bet she can’t wait to get outta here"
"0","The Gommage","38","3","Gustave","Not much hesitation on her part."
"0","The Gommage","38","4","Victor","Nah, hesitation was never her style."
"0","The Gommage","39","0","narrator","The people on the dock are the ones who won’t gommage. They are here to show their solidarity for those wearing flowers."
