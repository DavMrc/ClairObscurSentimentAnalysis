"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","0","Verso","You’ll get used to them, we’re going to see a lot more."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","1","Lune","If we hurry, we can cross before nightfall."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","2","Maelle","Wait. Could we bury Gustave?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","3","Lune","I wish we could, but protocol is to keep moving. Gustave would understand…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","4","Sciel","We can look for a suitable place. Along the way, yeah? We’ll find a nice spot."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","5","Verso","Actually. There is a place. Past the quarry, out of the sight of the Paintress. A tranquil haven protected by magnificent trees. I think you’ll approve."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","6","Lune","Lead the way."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","7","Verso","Let me show you something."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","8","Lune","Any other tricks we should know?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","0","9","Verso","One thing at a time."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","0","Sciel","These are all… Expeditions?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","1","Verso","A single Nevron took out most of them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","2","Lune","Is it still around?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","1","3","Verso","I’ve only seen him once, many years ago, so most likely not."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","2","0","Sciel","Looks like we passed the danger zone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","2","1","Lune","And no sign of your special Nevron."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","2","2","Verso","Guess we’re lucky."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","0","Verso","Hey, you holding up? We’re almost there."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","1","Maelle","Holding up? Everywhere we go, just death, death and more death. Everywhere we go, just death. I just- I don’t want to see that anymore."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","2","Verso","Look, Maelle, it-"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","3","Maelle","I thought YOU would understand. You said you spent your immortality burying the people around you. Doesn’t any of this bother you? And you. Gustave’s dead. How can you keep going like nothing happened!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","4","Sciel","We need to continue."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","5","Maelle","Why do you-"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","3","6","Sciel","Maelle. You know what we must do. “When one falls…” Come on."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","0","Sciel","Merde!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","1","Lune","Are you hurt?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","2","Maelle","I’m fine- (groan of pain) Thanks."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","4","3","Verso","Ready?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","5","0","Verso","Well, turns out this Nevron wasn’t that strong, but you did well. You learn fast."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","5","1","Lune","All this. This is what we’re fighting for."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","0","Maelle","Is this the place?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","1","Verso","Yeah. We can bury your friend under this tree, if that’s okay with you."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","2","Maelle","Couldn’t wait for me, could you? I wish we could-"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","3","Lune","Rest easy, Gustave."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","4","Maelle","I’ll finish what you started. The Paintress. Renoir. They will pay."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","5","Sciel","No more Dome, just open skies."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","6","Maelle","I’ll save them, Gustave. Emma, your apprentices, everyone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","7","Lune","You can leave it to us."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","8","Sciel","You were always there for me."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","9","Maelle","I’ll save them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","10","Sciel","Say hi to Soph for me, yeah?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","11","Maelle","We could never tell if you were my brother or my father. But to me, you were both. The best brother and father I’ve ever had."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","12","Lune","“When one falls, we continue.”"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","6","13","Maelle","Thanks for being my family. See you… in the next life."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","0","Verso","… for about two hours then there’s a big lake. We shouldn’t go there. At all. Like it’s- We should make a right and then it’s going to take a few hours, and then we make a stop, we get some rest and some food, and then from there, we head north to Monoco’s Station."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","1","Lune","Why there?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","2","Verso","To recruit my oldest friend. We’ll need the extra firepower, because our next goal will be to take down the Paintress’ heart."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","3","Sciel","Her heart?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","4","Verso","Yes. You can’t just stroll up to the Paintress. The Chroma there is far too dense, it erases anyone who gets close. But if we destroy her heart, the barrier will fall."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","5","Lune","Ok. So where is this heart? What does it look like?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","6","Verso","What does it look like? That, I don’t know. But I do know that it’s somewhere in the centre of Old Lumière."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","7","Sciel","You found Old Lumière?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","8","Verso","Yes."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","9","Lune","So it’s true. Before the Fracture, our Lumière was part of a larger city on the continent."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","10","Verso","I’ve travelled with many Expeditions. I was with the 58s when we found Old Lumière. But Renoir erased them, before we could get further. And I don’t know much more."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","7","11","Lune","Alright then. Let’s go meet your friend at Monoco’s Station. And then we’ll take the Paintress’ heart."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","0","Sciel","How far up the mountain is Monoco’s Station? Will we see snow?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","1","Verso","Not too high but yeah, there’s usually snow."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","2","Sciel","Ah, fantastic!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","3","Verso","Oh, right, there’s no snow in Lumière."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","4","Sciel","No, only in books and paintings; it’s almost as mythical as gestrals!"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","5","Verso","And just as fun. And sometimes just as deadly."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","6","Sciel","Oh, really? My husband was obsessed with the idea of snow. I can’t wait to see some."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","8","7","Verso","That you will."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","0","Lune","Your older friend is a gestral?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","1","Verso","Yes, we’ve been friends for as long as I can remember."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","2","Lune","Gustave would have loved that."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","3","Verso","Why? Because he liked Gestrals?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","9","4","Lune","Because… he liked the idea of friendships that could last decades. We don’t get to enjoy such long friendships in Lumière."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","0","Maelle","How come Monoco lives so far from the other gestrals?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","1","Verso","Monoco’s a “Searcher.” They travel the land looking for Gestrals who went missing after the Fracture."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","2","Maelle","The Lost Gestrals."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","10","3","Verso","Yeah. That, and he pissed off Golgra."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","0","Esquie","That was sad."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","1","Verso","Yeah."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","2","Esquie","You were sad."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","3","Verso","Um, yeah."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","4","Esquie","You were thinking of Julie?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","5","Verso","Not just her, but yeah."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","6","Esquie","Want a hug?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","11","7","Verso","Yeah, I do."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","12","0","narrator","Maelle finds a spot where she can write. She spends some time writing in Gustave’s journal, to honour his memory. She gathers her courage and writes about Gustave’s sacrifice. How he laid the trail. She hopes Gustave’s apprentices will read this journal someday."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","0","Sciel","What’re you working on?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","1","Lune","Contingency plans. If we fail, Expedition 32 will need every bit of information we have."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","2","Sciel","Right, but how’re you gonna get it to them?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","3","Lune","I asked the Gestrals for help."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","4","Sciel","Smart."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","5","Lune","What are the stars whispering to you?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","6","Sciel","Actually, I’m the one whispering to them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","7","Lune","Oh?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","8","Sciel","It’s something my dad and I used to do. When I was scared or anxious, or even when I was happy. He’d say… “share it with the stars… When it’s hard to talk about things… The stars’ll understand.”"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","9","Lune","I like that."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","10","Sciel","I talked to the stars a lot, after he was gone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","11","Lune","I remember. The night we first met. At the Crooked Tower."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","12","Sciel","Right. After the Gommage."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","13","Lune","I was surprised to find you here. I thought I was the only one who knew about that room."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","14","Sciel","I had to go away from the harbour. And those damn petals everywhere. So I climbed up."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","15","Lune","It wasn’t logical, but part of me really believed my parents and their expedition had succeeded. That they’d stopped Her. Then the Paintress woke. And I knew they weren’t coming home."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","16","Sciel","You know, it meant a lot to me, the comfort we shared that day. But you avoided me after. Why?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","17","Lune","I- It wasn’t personal. I- I cut a lot of people out of my life."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","18","Sciel","Ok. Not personal."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","19","Lune","That day, I knew my parents had failed. They were counting on me to finish their work. I couldn’t afford distractions."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","20","Sciel","Friends are not distractions."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","21","Lune","I know that now."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","22","Sciel","Well. We’re in the middle of nowhere with one year left to live. What better time to build friendships?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","23","Lune","Mm, I could use some wine though."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","13","24","Sciel","Making friends is thirsty work."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","14","0","narrator","Maelle quietly approaches Lune… Waiting to apologise for her behaviour on their way to bury Gustave."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","0","Maelle","Hey…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","1","Lune","Hey…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","2","Maelle","Um… I, um… I didn’t mean…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","3","Lune","It’s fine."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","4","Maelle","I just…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","5","Lune","I miss him too."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","6","Maelle","It’s… it’s hard."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","7","Lune","… The pain we feel… everytime we lose someone… I’ve tried many ways of dealing with it. Running from it. Sitting with it. Compartmentalising it. But what I needed… was to use it. To use everything."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","8","Maelle","What do you mean?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","9","Lune","I- Mm."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","10","Maelle","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","11","Lune","(exhale) I feel… everything… And I let it burn inside me. When I’m tired, when I feel hopeless, when I want to just let it all go… I use the pain, I use the fear, the shame, the guilt, the anger, I use it all to keep going. To make sure. I. Continue."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","12","Maelle","Lune…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","13","Lune","I can almost feel them beside me. Everyone we’ve lost… walking with me. Especially when I use chroma. I feel their presence, their closeness. And they help me."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","14","Maelle","You feel Gustave?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","15","Lune","Yeah, I do."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","16","Maelle","I’d like to feel him with me too…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","17","Lune","You have an affinity for chroma too. Try it."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","18","Maelle","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","19","Lune","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","20","Maelle","How do you always know what to do…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","21","Lune","I don’t. Want to know a secret? I have no idea what I’m doing. And I don’t think anyone else does either."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","22","Maelle","Huh. Really?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","23","Lune","Don’t tell anyone else I said that."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","15","24","Maelle","…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","16","0","narrator","Maelle and Lune spend more time together, in a moment that was special for both of them."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","0","Maelle","Thanks. It really was a beautiful place."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","1","Verso","Glad you liked it. I’ve buried friends there too. You were right. About condolences. We offer them, because we don’t know what else to say. But there’s no comfort there."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","2","Maelle","No."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","3","Verso","All we can do is carry them with us."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","4","Maelle","I guess. Sorry. It’s just- We’re…"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","5","Verso","Drowning in our own sadness? Hey. Why did you join the Expedition? I mean, with the Gommage- I understand the rest of the team’s decision, but you’re half their age."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","6","Maelle","Out here seemed better than in there. At the time."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","7","Verso","It’s natural, wanting to escape a life you don’t want."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","8","Maelle","Escape. yeah. That’s what I wanted. But Gustave and the others… They really want to change things."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","9","Verso","Changing your life also counts. Can’t always shoulder the world’s problems, you know? That’ll drain you fast."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","10","Maelle","Gustave would probably say, if more of us cared, then it would lighten the load for everyone."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","11","Verso","He sounds like a good guy."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","12","Maelle","Wait. I kept Gustave’s. So you can have mine. You’ll need one if you want to be an official member of our merry crew."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","13","Verso","I gotta say, I didn’t take you for an “official” kind of person."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","14","Maelle","Welcome to the Disaster Expedition."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","17","15","Verso","Thank you."
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","18","0","Lune","How far to Monoco’s Station?"
"10","Forgotten Battlefields","18","1","Verso","With Esquie, should be quick. Monoco’s Station is to the north, not far from here."
