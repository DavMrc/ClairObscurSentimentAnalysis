"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","0","0","Verso","See the trees here? They’re Gestrals, waiting to be reborn. They’re queuing."
"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","0","1","Lune","Oh."
"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","1","0","Grandis engineer","Greetings! Oh my, I’ve not met an Expeditioner in quite some time. Or anyone else, for that matter. Hello, hello, how wonderful to meet you!"
"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","1","1","Lune","A Grandis? What are you doing here?"
"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","1","2","Grandis engineer","Ah, I’ve been lost in these sunless woods for as long as I can remember. Luckily, I fell in with a rather “lively” crowd of Gestrals. They welcomed me as one of their own! It helped, I suppose, that I am an engineer by trade and could fix their weapons and Sakapatates. They do so love to fight, which resulted in quite a bit of breakage. Sadly, it also resulted in quite the death toll. And not all of it at the hands of Nevrons. Their zest for battle sometimes went too far, friendly fire and all that. Or maybe unfriendly fire. And though my Gestral friends could resurrect, the death toll grew so high that it overwhelmed the queue at their Sacred River. They were all my friends… And they kept dying and resurrecting… Losing their memory of me each time… It broke my heart, it did. I couldn’t bear it anymore, so I wrote to Golgra for help. That was perhaps not the best idea. Golgra’s solution was rather… severe. Golgra decided to kill every Gestral here and plant their bodies in the Ancient Sanctuary. I believe they’re still there now, awaiting their turn at the River."
"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","1","3","Lune","That must be… hard…"
"20","Endless Night Sanctuary","1","4","Grandis engineer","Such is the Gestral way. And just like that… I lost all my friends. It is a lonely, albeit more peaceful life these days. Anyway… I have worked tirelessly on improving their Sakaptate, to properly honour their memory. If you find them walking around, feel free to fight them! After all, this is what my friends would have wanted…"
