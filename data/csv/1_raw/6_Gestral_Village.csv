"6","Gestral Village","0","0","Gestral kid","Wow, the village looks so cool!!"
"6","Gestral Village","0","1","Gustave","Is this your first time here?"
"6","Gestral Village","0","2","Gestral kid","First time this life! I got revived at the Sacred River not too long ago. I’m only 3,7 hours old!"
"6","Gestral Village","0","3","Gustave","That’s interesting… Thank you, little one."
"6","Gestral Village","0","4","Gestral kid","Time to train! You should train too."
"6","Gestral Village","0","5","Gestral kid","(whisper)"
"6","Gestral Village","0","6","Gestral kid","I’m serious, you really need to train. Gotta train hard and get back to my old physique! Then I can go fight!"
"6","Gestral Village","0","7","Gustave","Your old physique? To fight?"
"6","Gestral Village","0","8","Gestral kid","Yeah, see, in my last life, I was allll muscle! But now I’m only 3,8 hours old, and I have to build myself up all over again, so I can prove myself in the arena!"
"6","Gestral Village","0","9","Gustave","(What is he talking about?)"
"6","Gestral Village","0","10","Gestral kid","Ok, time to go train. Like Golgra, time spent yapping is time you could have spent TRAINING. Wish me luck!"
"6","Gestral Village","1","0","Gestral","Welcome to the Gestral Village. Expeditioners, eh? You’re a fun looking bunch. Unless you try to cause problems. Then we’ll beat you up. Which will be fun for me, but not for you."
"6","Gestral Village","1","1","Gustave","Noted."
"6","Gestral Village","2","0","Gestral","Me? I’m a nice brush. Doesn’t mean I wouldn’t go for a nice little brawl with you."
"6","Gestral Village","2","1","Gustave","(It’s going to be like this everywhere, huh.)"
"6","Gestral Village","3","0","Lune","It’s… it’s really a village of Gestrals!"
"6","Gestral Village","3","1","Gustave","They seem better at surviving than humans."
"6","Gestral Village","3","2","Maelle","I guess intelligence is not a prerequisite for survival on the continent. Now to find the chief’s house. Probably the biggest one."
"6","Gestral Village","4","0","Gestral warrior","You may come in."
"6","Gestral Village","4","1","Golgra","So YOU’RE the warriors who demolished our ULTIMATE Sakapatate?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","2","Maelle","It wasn’t that strong."
"6","Gestral Village","4","3","Golgra","Hmmmm. I see. Well. You’ve earned my respect. What can I do for you?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","4","Lune","Are you the “Chef?”"
"6","Gestral Village","4","5","Golgra","I am indeed the “Chef” of our village. The name’s Golgra."
"6","Gestral Village","4","6","Lune","There are so many questions I’d love to ask–"
"6","Gestral Village","4","7","Gustave","We need to get to the Paintress. Noco said you could help us cross the sea?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","8","Golgra","Humans. Still so obsessed with the Paintress."
"6","Gestral Village","4","9","Lune","Others have passed through here?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","10","Golgra","A few of your expeditions, every few years. Hard to keep track. Hmmm. Do you not have your own boat? How did you get here in the first place?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","11","Lune","A white-haired man destroyed it."
"6","Gestral Village","4","12","Golgra","And you survived? My respect."
"6","Gestral Village","4","13","Lune","You know him?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","14","Golgra","He attacked the village once. Some of us survived. Somehow. Mmm. Ok. You have no boat. In that case, your best bet is Esquie. If you ask nicely, maybe Esquie can take you across the water."
"6","Gestral Village","4","15","Lune","So Esquie exists!"
"6","Gestral Village","4","16","Golgra","Of course! Esquie lives not far from here. But only the greatest warriors are allowed through. You need a password."
"6","Gestral Village","4","17","Maelle","Why?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","18","Golgra","Esquie is very friendly, but Esquie could also accidentally eat you. Esquie doesn’t know its own strength sometimes. It would be irresponsible to let weaklings visit Esquie."
"6","Gestral Village","4","19","Maelle","We already defeated your Ultimate Sakapatate."
"6","Gestral Village","4","20","Golgra","Not. Good. Enough. You’ll have to enter our Legendary Tournament to get the password. This is the Gestral way. You will be fighting our Legendary Warriors. They are old so it should be easy."
"6","Gestral Village","4","21","Lune","What is this tournament?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","22","Golgra","Now I’m excited. Let’s see what you can do. Oh, and you’ll also fight the Stranger. Yeah, that will be fun."
"6","Gestral Village","4","23","Lune","The Stranger?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","24","Golgra","Okay, enough talk. Go fight now. Do you want to go to the arena directly or do you want to beat up a few gestrals around here first?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","25","Lune","We’ll… look around first."
"6","Gestral Village","4","26","Golgra","Very well. The Arena is on the other side of the village when you’re ready."
"6","Gestral Village","5","0","Noco","You guys are so slow; I went on many other adventures and still I beat you here!"
"6","Gestral Village","6","0","Gestral","When I was little, I swore I’d enter the arena as soon as I turned thirty. My birthday was yesterday… And I’m so nervous I’ve started pulling all my bristles out. I’m too young to lose my bristles!! You’ve got lovely bristles too, so you must understand my pain!"
"6","Gestral Village","6","1","Lune","Uh, yes, I sure do."
"6","Gestral Village","6","2","Gestral","I can’t fight BALD! Although… Mandsol was bald and he’s the greatest champion of all time. Hmmm… that gives me an idea…"
"6","Gestral Village","7","0","Tall Gestral","You’re on your way to the Sakapatate factory? I hope they choose me as a test weapon!"
"6","Gestral Village","7","1","Lune","You sound way too eager about getting beaten up."
"6","Gestral Village","7","2","Tall Gestral","Oh yes, pain is life."
"6","Gestral Village","7","3","Lune","Good for you…"
"6","Gestral Village","7","4","Gestral kid","TASTE MY WRATH! BRUSH KICK!"
"6","Gestral Village","8","0","Gestral kid 1","They’re building new Sakapatates! Can’t wait to see what they come up with!"
"6","Gestral Village","8","1","Gestral kid 2","Yeah! I heard the new ones have laser cannons!"
"6","Gestral Village","8","2","Gestral kid 3","And a Void Sword! Can you imagine?"
"6","Gestral Village","8","3","Lune","That’s great, but could they make sure these Sakapatates only attack Nevrons?"
"6","Gestral Village","8","4","Gestral kid 2","No! It should attack Gestrals too so we can fight it!"
"6","Gestral Village","8","5","Gestral kid 1","Oh, good idea! Let’s tell them that!"
"6","Gestral Village","8","6","Gestral kid 3","FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"
"6","Gestral Village","8","7","Lune","It’s a wonder Gestrals have survived this long…"
"6","Gestral Village","9","0","Olivierso","Expeditioners who haven’t died yet! Incredible. You might have what it takes to triumph over the MOST dangerous of Nevrons."
"6","Gestral Village","9","1","Lune","We’ve fought plenty of dangerous Nevrons already."
"6","Gestral Village","9","2","Olivierso","Ha! But have you fought the CHROMATIC Nevrons? They have terrible strength and a powerful aura. They’ve wiped out entire expeditions on their own. So naturally, we wanted to fight them too. But many Gestrals have gotten squashed. If you too yearn for glorious battles, then seek out these Chromatic Nevrons! Hunt them all!"
"6","Gestral Village","9","3","Lune","…"
"6","Gestral Village","9","4","Olivierso","Now go! Make your people proud for the day you return to Lumière!"
"6","Gestral Village","10","0","Jujubree","Isn’t this stuff amazing!"
"6","Gestral Village","10","1","Gestral","No! It’s useless!"
"6","Gestral Village","10","2","Jujubree","At first, it’s amazing. Then it’s useless!"
"6","Gestral Village","10","3","Gestral","Alright, have a good day!"
"6","Gestral Village","10","4","Jujubree","Pleasure doing business with you! I think a beatdown is in order. Oh, hello, good humans, how do you do? enjoying the Gestral Bazaar?"
"6","Gestral Village","10","5","Lune","Eer, it’s okay."
"6","Gestral Village","10","6","Jujubree","Great: I’m glad our… eagerness for battle hasn’t scared you away."
"6","Gestral Village","10","7","Lune","Why? Are you desperate for clients?"
"6","Gestral Village","10","8","Jujubree","Oh, no, no, no! I have plenty of clients, they’re just… dead! Haha. Anyway! I have some useful items for you!"
"6","Gestral Village","10","9","Lune","For us?"
"6","Gestral Village","10","10","Jujubree","Yes! Whether it’s weapons or Pictos. I cater to your every need! My name is Jujubree, and I proudly announce that… The Expedition Shop is back in business! I got DESTROYED. Heheh, I have stuff you might want to buy! I hope you like what you see."
"6","Gestral Village","11","0","narrator","After getting the weird looking Pictos"
"6","Gestral Village","12","0","Jujubree","What a weird looking Pictos you have here. Could you show it to me for a second?"
"6","Gestral Village","12","1","Lune","(You hand the Weird Pictos to Jujubree)"
"6","Gestral Village","12","2","Jujubree","You see, I found a similar Pictos not too long ago. Let me see if– Ha-HA! I think it’s complete now! No need to thank me, hehe."
"6","Gestral Village","13","0","Gestral","Bah, I wanna get stuff, but I’ve got nothing to trade…"
"6","Gestral Village","13","1","Lune","What’s the currency here?"
"6","Gestral Village","13","2","Gestral","It’s a barter system, bud, no currency. You can trade Chroma though."
"6","Gestral Village","13","3","Lune","Oh? But what use do you have for Chroma?"
"6","Gestral Village","13","4","Gestral","We make Chroma offerings at the Sacred River. Part of the rebirth process. Because we, Gestrals, can resurrect at the Sacred River. You guys knew that, right?"
"6","Gestral Village","14","0","Gestral","My old patate says I’m too small a patate to fight Nevrons."
"6","Gestral Village","14","1","Lune","You are too young to fight Nevrons."
"6","Gestral Village","14","2","Gestral","BWAAAAAAAAAAH!"
"6","Gestral Village","15","0","Lune","Are you alright?"
"6","Gestral Village","15","1","Gestral merchant","I just traded all of my junk to get this. “Professor Champ de Cuivre’s chromatic legumes.” These are miracle vegetable seeds from the city of Lumière."
"6","Gestral Village","15","2","Lune","(“From Lumière”, huh? A classic swindler’s trick.)"
"6","Gestral Village","15","3","Gestral merchant","With these, I’ll become rich, and finally own the Bazar… They’ll see."
"6","Gestral Village","15","4","Lune","(Poor guy.)"
"6","Gestral Village","16","0","Berrami","Lumièrans! Too bad Moshi’s in hibernation, Moshi loved Expeditioners. Knew more than anyone else about them. I got Moshi’s notes somewhere, if you’re interested. “… incredible writing and relics of a mysterious group of beings. I believe they are the ones Verso referred to as Lumièrans! They are not a myth! Though my Searching days are long past, I am grateful to all the new Searchers who helped this old Gestral add to this marvellous and DEFINITIVE collection of Lumièran writings – Moshi the Searcher, Year 43.”"
"6","Gestral Village","16","1","Lune","Fascinating."
"6","Gestral Village","16","2","Berrami","I want to reassemble the book for Ol’ Moshi. You lot have been travelling around, yeah? You seen any of these writings?"
"6","Gestral Village","16","3","Lune","Actually …"
"6","Gestral Village","16","4","Lune","(show Expedition journals)"
"6","Gestral Village","16","5","Berrami","FA-BU-LOUS! Let me copy these. If you find more, save me a copy, will ya?"
"6","Gestral Village","16","6","Lune","Oh, but I’m not sure we’ll be back anytime soon."
"6","Gestral Village","16","7","Berrami","Don’t worry. I’ll wait. If you find more journals, save me a copy, will ya? Give me 5 more, and I’ll reward ya greatly."
"6","Gestral Village","17","0","Gestral merchant","Back off my junk. I won’t sell you nuthin’."
"6","Gestral Village","17","1","Lune","What do you mean, will you or won’t you sell me something?"
"6","Gestral Village","17","2","Gestral merchant","Means I’m callin’ the guards on ya."
"6","Gestral Village","17","3","Lune","Got it, backing off right now."
"6","Gestral Village","18","0","Gestral","I want to trade your stuff for my stuff."
"6","Gestral Village","18","1","Gestral merchant","Your stuff is worthless."
"6","Gestral Village","18","2","Gestral","You’re worthless."
"6","Gestral Village","18","3","Gestral merchant","Wanna fight?"
"6","Gestral Village","18","4","Gestral","No, I’ll just stay here and look at your stuff."
"6","Gestral Village","18","5","Gestral merchant","Okay, cool. Business is boomin’."
"6","Gestral Village","19","0","Shady Gestral","My shop is in the back alley. Want me to show you the good stuff, adventurers?"
"6","Gestral Village","19","1","Lune","(Cliché, but okay.)"
"6","Gestral Village","19","2","Eesda","Give us all of your belongings. They’re ours now."
"6","Gestral Village","19","3","Lune","A shakedown? You don’t know how to pick your marks, do you?"
"6","Gestral Village","19","4","Shady Gestral","Oh, we know. Our marks are the people with fat pockets."
"6","Gestral Village","19","5","Lune","Heh, wrong. Looks like we’re about to give you guys a lesson."
"6","Gestral Village","19","6","Shady Gestral","OWW, THAT HURTS!!"
"6","Gestral Village","19","7","Eesda","Okay, we’re sorry!! Just for you, we’ll trade the things we have!! You can even pay with Chroma! Spare us, please!"
"6","Gestral Village","19","8","Lune","(Hey, pretty convenient.)"
"6","Gestral Village","19","9","Eesda","Please, take a look at our stuff, strong one…"
"6","Gestral Village","20","0","Gestral worker","Hey, Expeditioners! Wanna help build the next model of Sakapatate?"
"6","Gestral Village","20","1","Lune","Really?"
"6","Gestral Village","20","2","Gestral worker","I was obviously joking. This task is way too complicated for pea-brained humans."
"6","Gestral Village","20","3","Lune","Pea-brained? What do they teach you in school?"
"6","Gestral Village","20","4","Gestral worker","Skool? I don’t know what that is, but it sounds cool."
"6","Gestral Village","21","0","Gestral worker","I need to do it faster, eheheheh."
"6","Gestral Village","21","1","Lune","What are you building?"
"6","Gestral Village","21","2","Gestral worker","Heheheheheh!!"
"6","Gestral Village","21","3","Lune","Okay, I guess."
"6","Gestral Village","22","0","Gestral","You guys comin’ to see the joust games? It’s the newest trend in town. Nothing beats a good old fight to the death in the arena though."
"6","Gestral Village","23","0","Gestral","My hope is that one of these days, everybody’s troubles will be resolved through jousting. I mean, fighting is so dépassé."
"6","Gestral Village","23","1","Lune","I think I’ll stick with the old method for now."
"6","Gestral Village","23","2","Gestral","So you guys up for some jousting?"
"6","Gestral Village","23","3","Lune","Err, not really, no."
"6","Gestral Village","23","4","Gestral","That’s too bad. When we want a break from fighting, we joust. Best game there is."
"6","Gestral Village","23","5","Lune","Jousting is still a form of fighting though."
"6","Gestral Village","23","6","Gestral","Not everyone knows that, don’t ruin the fun for them! My kiddo prefers jousting to fighting… So if he ever knows that it’s just fighting with more rules, he’s gonna have a meltdown."
"6","Gestral Village","24","0","Gestral","Welcome to the most boringest neighbourhood in the whole Village. The Infirmary. I mean, who wants to heal their cuts?? Keep your scars like a real Gestral to remind you of the beauty of battle!"
"6","Gestral Village","24","1","Lune","A bit too gloomy for me, thanks."
"6","Gestral Village","24","2","Gestral kid","We’ve got a lot of injured right now. The Nevrons attacked not too long ago. I’d rather die than come back to the village injured. Looks beyoooond boring, sleeping all day up there."
"6","Gestral Village","24","3","Gestral doctor","I don’t feel like healing people today."
"6","Gestral Village","24","4","Lune","Guess they will all die then."
"6","Gestral Village","24","5","Gestral doctor","Yeah, it’s no big deal."
"6","Gestral Village","24","6","Lune","You’re the worst doctor. And why are you so big?"
"6","Gestral Village","24","7","Gestral doctor","I ate a lot of Nevrons."
"6","Gestral Village","24","8","Lune","You eat Nevrons??"
"6","Gestral Village","24","9","Gestral doctor","I’m kidding. I was born with this terrible sickness that makes my bones grow every day. Every day, I feel the excruciating pain of my bones pushing the boundaries of my flesh. Every day, I wish I was not born to suffer like this. So one day, I decided I don’t want anyone to suffer the way I do. I studied very hard, harder than anyone else to become a doctor. Even if there is no competition here because everyone is dumb. I pushed myself through self-discipline. And I saved more than ten thousand of my fellow Gestrals. All the while, suffering inside like no one else in the world. So don’t tell me what I am. Don’t tell me who you are. Because the most horrible thing you’ve gone through in your life, I go through every day."
"6","Gestral Village","24","10","Lune","Ok… Sorry…"
"6","Gestral Village","25","0","Gestral kid 1","We finally got him cornered."
"6","Gestral Village","25","1","Gestral kid 2","He’s gonna pay this time."
"6","Gestral Village","25","2","Strong-looking Gestral","W-what? What did I d-do?"
"6","Gestral Village","25","3","Gestral kid 1","Give me back my Gestral hero figurine!!"
"6","Gestral Village","25","4","Gestral kid 2","Yeah, you filthy thief! Give it back."
"6","Gestral Village","25","5","Strong-looking Gestral","Noo! I didn’t do anythinggg!"
"6","Gestral Village","25","6","Lune","(I hope this doesn’t escalate for this poor guy.)"
"6","Gestral Village","26","0","Gestral","I didn’t want him to be mad, I was only joking. But now, it’s too late to back down. So I’ll stand my ground, and pretend to be mad."
"6","Gestral Village","26","1","Gestral","What, you wanna argue with me too? So everybody wants me to go, is that it?!"
"6","Gestral Village","27","0","Gestral warrior 1","WE’RE TRAINING–"
"6","Gestral Village","27","1","Gestral warrior 2","TRAINING–"

"6","Gestral Village","28","1","Lune","No."
"6","Gestral Village","28","2","Gestral warrior","You think you’re tough wood, huh??"
"6","Gestral Village","28","3","Lune","Yes."
"6","Gestral Village","28","4","Gestral warrior","Well, I’m tougher. And woodier. I’ll tear you in two."
"6","Gestral Village","28","5","Gestral warrior","(fight)"
"6","Gestral Village","28","6","Gestral warrior","O-Okay. I’m just a little twig on your pathway, don’t mind me. Huuu–"
"6","Gestral Village","29","0","Gestral","I came to see Matthieu the Colossus! I hope he’s coming! Though rumour is, he’s a mere bristle of his former self."
"6","Gestral Village","29","1","Gestral Arena fan 1","HEY, “DOMINIQUE GIANT FEET” GANG HERE."
"6","Gestral Village","29","2","Gestral Arena fan 2","WE’RE FAN OF “BERTRAND BIG HANDS”, PATATE."
"6","Gestral Village","29","3","Gestral Arena fan 1","DON’T CALL ME PATATE. DOMINIQUE HAS BIGGER FEET THAN THAT BRUSH’S HANDS."
"6","Gestral Village","29","4","Gestral Arena fan 2","WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BERTRAND’S HANDS ARE SO BIG HE COULD GRAB THE PAINTRESS AND POWER BOMB HER FROM THE STRATOSPHERE."
"6","Gestral Village","29","5","Gestral kid","I’m a “JulienTiny Head” fan."
"6","Gestral Village","30","0","Strong-looking Gestral","Hey, humans. I suggest you turn back. This place is not for the faint of heart."
"6","Gestral Village","30","1","Lune","Why, what’s happening here?"
"6","Gestral Village","30","2","Strong-looking Gestral","You know how we Gestrals love a good fight?"
"6","Gestral Village","30","3","Lune","That’s an understatement."
"6","Gestral Village","30","4","Strong-looking Gestral","Heh, yeah, that’s right! See, this here’s where we come when we wanna go full brush-mode, you got me? It’s the designated “no-rule” zone, so… you’ve been warned."
"6","Gestral Village","30","5","Gestral warrior 1","Come on and fight, you prick!"
"6","Gestral Village","30","6","Gestral warrior 2","No, you approach, stinkard!"
"6","Gestral Village","31","0","Gestral elder","Hello."
"6","Gestral Village","31","1","Gestral marchand","Hello."
"6","Gestral Village","31","2","Gestral elder","Do you want to trade some cards, my good sir?"
"6","Gestral Village","31","3","Gestral marchand","Yes. In a most discreet but respectful manner, I hope."
"6","Gestral Village","31","4","Gestral elder","Indubitably."
"6","Gestral Village","32","0","Gestral","Over there is the…"
"6","Gestral Village","32","1","Gestral","(gag)"
"6","Gestral Village","32","2","Gestral","Ugh… you don’t wanna go there."
"6","Gestral Village","32","3","Lune","Why? What’s there?"
"6","Gestral Village","32","4","Gestral","The daft old geezer’s building a casino. Gambling and stuff. No fighting allowed. Games are cool, but no fighting? What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that? Makes me sick. Don’t worry. I’m not gonna puke, like, right now. Maybe later, though."
"6","Gestral Village","33","0","Gestral","I built all this alone. I am classy, I am elegant, and yet they treat me like a monster."
"6","Gestral Village","33","1","Lune","That’s impressive, you’re quite the hard worker."
"6","Gestral Village","33","2","Gestral","They will never understand. One day, this place will be full of casinos and everyone will listen to jazz."
"6","Gestral Village","33","3","Lune","I hope we’ll be alive to see it happen."
"6","Gestral Village","34","0","Gestral gambler","Hey, Expeditioners! Do you like gambling?"
"6","Gestral Village","34","1","Lune","Yes."
"6","Gestral Village","34","2","Gestral gambler","I knew it. I saw it in your eyes. If you’re really the gambling-type, you should be able to answer this correctly. Let’s say that every time that I hit, I have a 50% chance of dealing 100% more damage. What are my chances of dealing more damage in the long run?"
"6","Gestral Village","34","3","Lune","I don’t care."
"6","Gestral Village","34","4","Gestral gambler","CORRECT! It doesn’t matter ‘cause it just makes things more thrilling. A true gambler at heart. Here, take this as a sign of our eternal friendship. May your battles bring you lots of excitement."
"6","Gestral Village","35","0","Gestral warrior","What did I get a house with a view of the stupid theatre? I want to be a REAL Gestral hero, not a pretend one like those brush heads running around their stage."
"6","Gestral Village","35","1","Lune","What’s a Gestral hero?"
"6","Gestral Village","35","2","Gestral warrior","Ahhh, a Gestral hero is an absolute battle GENIUS whose combat prowess is so dominant, they can single-handedly protect the entire village against the foulest of Nevrons!"
"6","Gestral Village","36","0","Alexcyclo","Stylé."
"6","Gestral Village","36","1","Lune","Huh?"
"6","Gestral Village","36","2","Alexcyclo","What I mean to say is, “What a fashionable ensemble!” I have some stylish pieces for sale, very"

"6","Gestral Village","37","4","Lune","Isn’t it just a smaller arena?"
"6","Gestral Village","37","5","Gestral","… You’re a visionary."
"6","Gestral Village","38","0","Gestral merchant","In the palm of your hand I can read… A life of fighting."
"6","Gestral Village","38","1","Gestral kid","YEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"
"6","Gestral Village","39","0","Gestral worker","This is a sacred place."
"6","Gestral Village","39","1","Lune","We saw this door before."
"6","Gestral Village","39","2","Gestral worker","Pfft, of course you have. These doors are all over the continent."
"6","Gestral Village","39","3","Lune","What’s with the huge manor inside?"
"6","Gestral Village","39","4","Gestral worker","Whaaat? You’ve been INSIDE??"
"6","Gestral Village","39","5","Lune","Oh, so you’ve never been teleported to the ominous, perfectly maintained manor?"
"6","Gestral Village","39","6","Gestral worker","It’s never opened before. At least, not for us Gestrals. Wowww."
"6","Gestral Village","40","0","Gestral","The guy next door says he is a philosopher, but I am the real philosopher."

"6","Gestral Village","40","4","Gestral","Buy my books."

"6","Gestral Village","41","3","Lune","Huh?"
"6","Gestral Village","41","4","Gestral","I am a philosopher. I hope you buy my books someday."
"6","Gestral Village","42","0","Gestral","The Paintress… She will get us all…"
"6","Gestral Village","42","1","Lune","I thought Gestrals were not affected by her power?"
"6","Gestral Village","42","2","Gestral","Oh, I know. I’m trying to speak your language. Another human group came here some time before and that’s what they told me."
"6","Gestral Village","42","3","Lune","Another Expedition?"
"6","Gestral Village","42","4","Gestral","Yeah, same ridiculous uniform."
"6","Gestral Village","42","5","Lune","You remember their number? Their name?"
"6","Gestral Village","42","6","Gestral","No, they get beat up and left pretty fast."
"6","Gestral Village","43","0","Victorifo","Hmmmm– HMM?? I was having a nice little nap on my stairs. You better not have woken me up just so you could steal in my house. Owowow, okay, okay. You beat me, alright? Now, please, leave, I want to be alone."
"6","Gestral Village","44","0","Golgra","Go to the arena and show me your strength, Expeditioners. Do you want to go to the arena directly, or do you want to beat up a few Gestrals around here first?"
"6","Gestral Village","44","1","Lune","Take us to the arena."
"6","Gestral Village","44","2","Golgra","That’s the Gestral spirit."
"6","Gestral Village","44","3","Lune","Lead the way. Guess we have to enter the tournament now."
"6","Gestral Village","45","0","Gestral warrior","The tournament has begun. Find Limonsol if you want to sign up. You can find him over there."
"6","Gestral Village","45","1","Limonsol","You wanna register for the tournament? You’re talking to the right Gestral. So far, we’ve got sign-ups for three of our legendary champions. And… a mysterious new warrior. Did I mention the prize is a powerful weapon? So how ‘bout this?"
"6","Gestral Village","45","2","Maelle","Count us in."
"6","Gestral Village","45","3","Limonsol","Oho, I appreciated the enthusiasm. Unfortunately, in the arena, it’s one-on-one fights only. No worries though. I’ll sign you up as a team. Just decide before each fight who gets the honour of getting beat up."
"6","Gestral Village","45","4","Maelle","Got it."
"6","Gestral Village","45","5","Limonsol","Alright, you’re all signed up! Your opponent is one of our legendary champions. Berttrand Big Hands!! Who’s gonna go fight? Gustave/Lune/Maelle it is. I hope you are ready!"
"6","Gestral Village","46","0","Limonsol","You won! Wow. Next time won’t be so easy, I’m sure. Your opponent is one of our legendary champions. Dominique Giant Feet!! Who’s gonna go fight? Gustave/Lune/Maelle it is. I hope you are ready!"
"6","Gestral Village","47","0","Limonsol","You won! Wow. Next time won’t be so easy, I’m sure. Your opponent is one of our legendary champions. Matthieu the Colossus!!! Who’s gonna go fight? Gustave/Lune/Maelle it is. I hope you are ready!"
"6","Gestral Village","48","0","Limonsol","You won! Wow. Next time won’t be so easy, I’m sure. You’ll be fighting against the mysterious new warrior. I hope you’re prepared otherwise the prize will go to them! Gustave/Lune/Maelle it is. Good luck!"
"6","Gestral Village","49","0","Gestral announcer","And NOW! The man who single-handedly destroyed a Sakapatate."
"6","Gestral Village","49","1","Maelle","Wait– That’s–"
"6","Gestral Village","49","2","Gustave","Sciel?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","3","Sciel","What– How– You guys– You’re alive! I thought I was the only one left– I knew you were resourceful."
"6","Gestral Village","49","4","Lune","How did you get here?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","5","Gestral announcer","Hey, humans! We’re here to see some fighting! If you don’t wanna fight, we’ll come down and fight ourselves!"
"6","Gestral Village","49","6","Sciel","They’re expecting a bit of a show. Shall we?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","0","Maelle","Well, that wasn’t so bad."
"6","Gestral Village","50","1","Gustave","Yeah, really just felt like beating old people."
"6","Gestral Village","50","2","Maelle","So it wasn’t so bad."
"6","Gestral Village","50","3","Sciel","Am I one of those old people?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","4","Gustave","One day, I hope. Hey, how’d you end up here?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","5","Sciel","Oh, um. After the beach– I ended up in an odd yellow forest, not too far from here. Had to dodge a few Nevrons. But luckily, I met a Gestral who guided me here. What about you?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","6","Gustave","Um… Well, I– I woke up near to a waterfall and–"
"6","Gestral Village","50","7","Lune","We can talk later. Let’s go back to Golgra."
"6","Gestral Village","50","8","Gustave","No time to lose."
"6","Gestral Village","51","0","Golgra","You return as champions. Well done, well done. Ok then, you ready? The password is– “Get outta my way.”"
"6","Gestral Village","51","1","Maelle","The password is “get outta my way?”"
"6","Gestral Village","51","2","Sciel","Very gestral-ish."
"6","Gestral Village","51","3","Golgra","Esquie’s Nest is east of the Village. Sunniso guards the path. Shout the password as loud as you can and Sunniso will let you through."
"6","Gestral Village","51","4","Sciel","“As loud as we can.” Got it."
"6","Gestral Village","51","5","Gustave","Thank you. For everything."
"6","Gestral Village","51","6","Golgra","Try not to die too soon."
"6","Gestral Village","51","7","Maelle","Gestral positivity is so heart-warming."
"6","Gestral Village","51","8","Golgra","One more thing. We’ve opened the back door for you. It’ll be easier to come back and visit us."
"6","Gestral Village","51","9","Sciel","Thanks, Chief."
"6","Gestral Village","52","0","Sciel","I still can’t believe it. I lost hope after a while, but you all survived."
"6","Gestral Village","52","1","Gustave","What was your plan if we hadn’t? Be a gestral champion until your Gommage?"
"6","Gestral Village","52","2","Sciel","Well, it was a lot of fun so, yeah, maybe?"
"6","Gestral Village","53","0","Lune","Noco’s quite obsessed with your arm. Your apprentices will be extremely proud knowing a Gestral loves their work."
"6","Gestral Village","53","1","Gustave","Yeah, they’d be insanely excited."
"6","Gestral Village","53","2","Lune","Well, they did a great job designing your arm. It was quite a creative assignement you gave them."
"6","Gestral Village","53","3","Gustave","Well, when life gives you lemons…"
"6","Gestral Village","53","4","Lune","Losing an arm is quite a lemon."
"6","Gestral Village","53","5","Gustave","Yeah, it’s not limonade."
"6","Gestral Village","53","6","Lune","(laughs)"
"6","Gestral Village","54","0","Gustave","…"
"6","Gestral Village","54","1","Maelle","…"
"6","Gestral Village","54","2","Gustave","… Maybe you should stay…"
"6","Gestral Village","54","3","Maelle","What?"
"6","Gestral Village","54","4","Gustave","It’s safer in the village."
"6","Gestral Village","54","5","Maelle","And miss the chance to meet Esquie? No way!"
"6","Gestral Village","54","6","Gustave","Maelle…"
"6","Gestral Village","54","7","Maelle","I’m ok. We stick together."
"6","Gestral Village","54","8","Gustave","…"
"6","Gestral Village","55","0","Gustave","You okay? You’ve been quiet since we left the Village."
"6","Gestral Village","55","1","Sciel","Yeah. Sorry… Bad memories."
"6","Gestral Village","55","2","Gustave","Wanna talk about it?"
"6","Gestral Village","55","3","Sciel","Hm, no."
"6","Gestral Village","55","4","Gustave","Hm, nah…"
"6","Gestral Village","55","5","Sciel","I’m glad you’re here."
"6","Gestral Village","55","6","Gustave","I would never abandon a member of Aquafarm 3."
"6","Gestral Village","55","7","Sciel","Aquafarm 3. That was so long ago. You and Sophie were inseparable on that project."
"6","Gestral Village","55","8","Gustave","Yeah, we were."
"6","Gestral Village","55","9","Sciel","It was a good project. It fed so many neighbourhoods at once. Kinda nostalgic, thinking back. We really thought we were making a difference."
"6","Gestral Village","55","10","Gustave","Hey, we’re still making a différence."
"6","Gestral Village","55","11","Sciel","Yes. Of course!"
"6","Gestral Village","55","12","Gustave","Yeah…"
"6","Gestral Village","56","0","narrator","Gustave finds a spot where he can be alone. He spends some time writing in his journal. He writes about Gestrals, he knows how happy his apprentices will be to learn that they exist. He hopes that one day, his apprentices will read everything he wrote."
"6","Gestral Village","57","0","Gustave","For those who come after."
"6","Gestral Village","58","0","Sciel","I can’t believe it. We’re gonna meet THE Esquie."
"6","Gestral Village","58","1","Lune","The Gestrals. And Esquie. The tales are true."
"6","Gestral Village","58","2","Maelle","Do you feel someth– White hair… Who are you?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","3","White-haired man","Alicia. I told you to stay home. It’s not good for you to see this. Yes. Yes, I understand. It’s her fault and she doesn’t even know it. But you can’t be here."
"6","Gestral Village","58","4","Maelle","What are you talking about? What’s my fault?! What is this?!"
"6","Gestral Village","58","5","White-haired man","You should never have come. You’re only going to make things worse. For everyone. Now take your friends and go home. Let them spend their final year in peace. This is your only warning."
"6","Gestral Village","58","6","Sciel","I can’t wait to see–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","7","Gustave","Maelle? Hey, hey, hey…"
"6","Gestral Village","58","8","Maelle","It was him! It was him! The white-haired man– and this woman–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","9","Gustave","Wai– Where– What are you talking about?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","10","Lune","Maelle, breathe. Slow down. What did you see? Think carefully. Every detail could be important."
"6","Gestral Village","58","11","Maelle","He said– He said we need to go… home. And that it’s– It’s my fault? That I’m– I’m gonna make things… worse. For everyone. You were all– frozen. I couldn’t– I couldn’t– It was like– a waking nightmare."
"6","Gestral Village","58","12","Gustave","It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s over."
"6","Gestral Village","58","13","Lune","What else? You said there was a woman?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","14","Sciel","Lune, maybe later."
"6","Gestral Village","58","15","Maelle","She– She had a mask– And–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","16","Lune","I know this is hard, but I need you to focus, okay? While the details are fresh."
"6","Gestral Village","58","17","Gustave","Lune. Ask her tomorrow. Hey, hey. Breathe. Silent to me. You’re safe. Do you understand? Okay? It’s over."
"6","Gestral Village","59","0","Gustave","Feeling better?"
"6","Gestral Village","59","1","Maelle","Yeah–"
"6","Gestral Village","59","2","Lune","We can debrief along the way. Let’s head east to Esquie’s Nest."
