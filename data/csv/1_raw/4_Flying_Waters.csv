"4","Flying Waters","0","0","Gustave","68. Elodie’s expedition."
"4","Flying Waters","0","1","Lune","You know the commanders of every expedition?"
"4","Flying Waters","0","2","Gustave","Expedition 68. Their boat was blown into the air by a storm. Lumière lost sight of it, but assumed they crashed on the continent."
"4","Flying Waters","0","3","Lune","And they survived. The storm, at least."
"4","Flying Waters","0","4","Gustave","Alright, let’s keep moving. We’ve found the “weird corals.” Maelle must be close by."
"4","Flying Waters","1","0","Lune","Wait. Nevron. Looks like a different species."
"4","Flying Waters","1","1","Gustave","Doesn’t matter. They’re between us and Maelle."
"4","Flying Waters","1","2","Lune","Those mines… Be careful."
"4","Flying Waters","2","0","Gustave","Over there! A hut."
"4","Flying Waters","2","1","Lune","Slow down, we don’t know what’s inside yet."
"4","Flying Waters","2","2","Gustave","Look, there’s a door inside."
"4","Flying Waters","2","3","Lune","Seems empty. Let’s go. Someone lives her– Fuck!"
"4","Flying Waters","3","0","Lune","Where are we? This is–"
"4","Flying Waters","3","1","Gustave","MAELLE!"
"4","Flying Waters","4","0","Gustave","Maelle?"
"4","Flying Waters","4","1","Maelle","Gustave? Are you real? Ooof. Well, you sure smell real enough."
"4","Flying Waters","4","2","Gustave","No, I don’t. I’m sorry. I thought that y– On the beach, I saw you and I… I couldn’t… I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I shoul– I should’ve– I should’ve come for you, and…"
"4","Flying Waters","4","3","Maelle","It’s okay. It’s okay. We made it."
"4","Flying Waters","4","4","Gustave","I was worried."
"4","Flying Waters","4","5","Lune","How did you end up here?"
"4","Flying Waters","4","6","Maelle","I don’t know– It’s all a blur. I remember everyone at the beach. Then I woke up here. With– with him. He’s been helping me a lot. He reinforced all my Pictos."
"4","Flying Waters","4","7","Lune","What is he?"
"4","Flying Waters","4","8","Maelle","I’m not sure, he doesn’t really talk."
"4","Flying Waters","4","9","Lune","The chroma around him. It’s… it’s quite different from the Nevrons."
"4","Flying Waters","5","0","Maelle","How did you find me?"
"4","Flying Waters","5","1","Gustave","There was a message at the Indigo Tree."
"4","Flying Waters","5","2","Lune","Do you know who left it?"
"4","Flying Waters","5","3","Maelle","A message? Maybe… No, I don’t know."
"4","Flying Waters","6","0","The Curator","…"
"4","Flying Waters","6","1","Maelle","Again? We just trained earlier!"
"4","Flying Waters","6","2","The Curator","…"
"4","Flying Waters","6","3","Maelle","Alright, alright. But this time, I have backup!"
"4","Flying Waters","7","0","The Curator","…"
"4","Flying Waters","7","1","Maelle","That was fun, but I think we’ve had enough training today."
"4","Flying Waters","7","2","The Curator","…"
"4","Flying Waters","7","3","Maelle","You could come with us, if you like?"
"4","Flying Waters","7","4","The Curator","…"
"4","Flying Waters","7","5","Maelle","If that’s a yes, we’ll see you at the camp."
"4","Flying Waters","7","6","The Curator","…"
"4","Flying Waters","8","0","narrator","The Curator has left. Perhaps he will join you at camp."
"4","Flying Waters","9","0","Lune","… the manor and maybe learn something…"
"4","Flying Waters","9","1","Gustave","… yeah, or we could get back to the Indigo Tree…"
"4","Flying Waters","9","2","Maelle","Huh, Noco’s usually here, I wonder where–"
"4","Flying Waters","9","3","Lune","Is that– A Gestral??"
"4","Flying Waters","9","4","Noco","INTRUDERS! Oh, Verso would NOT be pleased. EN GARDE, RUFFIANTS!"
"4","Flying Waters","9","5","Maelle","Stop that, you big hairy brush face. Can’t you see they’re human? Noco’s a bit dramatic. But if you’re nice, Noco will trade you lots of useful items for chroma."
"4","Flying Waters","9","6","Noco","Hrmph. I don’t just trade with ANYONE. Only WORTHY WARRIORS! Are you worthy, moustache man?? Hmm, although, I do like that brush on your face."
"4","Flying Waters","9","7","Lune","So the tales are true– Perhaps the Grandis and the Esquie exist too? Are there more gestrals, like you? I’d love to meet them."
"4","Flying Waters","9","8","Noco","Maybe."
"4","Flying Waters","9","9","Maelle","Noco, you silly scruff! Their village is not far from here."
"4","Flying Waters","9","10","Lune","Oh, really?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","11","Gustave","Lune?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","12","Lune","I know. We don’t have time for detours."
"4","Flying Waters","9","13","Gustave","Yeah, we need to get to the Paintress."
"4","Flying Waters","9","14","Noco","The Paintress? How you gonna cross the sea? You’re so slow. And you have no fins."
"4","Flying Waters","9","15","Lune","There’s another sea between here and the Paintress?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","16","Maelle","Noco, as the BEST Gestral merchant ever, I bet you know a solution? Yeah?"
"4","Flying Waters","9","17","Noco","Mmmmmm. Maybe."
"4","Flying Waters","9","18","Maelle","COME ON, you broomhead. I know you know."
"4","Flying Waters","9","19","Noco","Ahaha, broomhead, that’s good! Excellent, excellent insult! Ok, ok, ask Golgra. Chef has the answer, just go to the Village. In the middle of our Ancient Sanctuary. Red trees everywhere, can’t miss it!"
"4","Flying Waters","9","20","Gustave","Well, I guess you’ll get to meet more Gestrals."
"4","Flying Waters","10","0","Lune","These dead Nevrons– Who could’ve done this?"
"4","Flying Waters","10","1","Maelle","Guess."
"4","Flying Waters","10","2","Gustave","So you didn’t just stay in your mansion. Guess we found 68’s boat."
"4","Flying Waters","10","3","Maelle","There’s a path through the boat."
"4","Flying Waters","10","4","Lune","That anchor doesn’t look man made…"
"4","Flying Waters","11","0","Lune","It’s forging something. So they have intelligence."
"4","Flying Waters","11","1","Gustave","So many– I don’t like this– Merde. This one is gigantic–"
"4","Flying Waters","11","2","Maelle","Avoid those at all costs."
"4","Flying Waters","12","0","Maelle","This building has a certain melancholy beauty. A lone outpost of humanity, nestled amongst the corals. A sailor lost at sea."
"4","Flying Waters","12","1","Gustave","Our resident cynic is now a poet."
"4","Flying Waters","12","2","Maelle","Wouldn’t expect a cartesian engineer to understand beauty."
"4","Flying Waters","13","0","Lune","Watch out!"
"4","Flying Waters","13","1","Gustave","You alright?"
"4","Flying Waters","13","2","Lune","It only attacked when–"
"4","Flying Waters","13","3","Maelle","It’s coming!"
"4","Flying Waters","14","0","Lune","Gustave, wait! It seems peaceful, as long as we don’t touch the flowers."
"4","Flying Waters","14","1","Gustave","Yeah, well, let’s not get too sentimental. It’s still a Paintress creation. PUTAIN! Damn, Maelle, what was that?"
"4","Flying Waters","14","2","Maelle","It felt… familiar, somehow…"
"4","Flying Waters","14","3","Lune","Gustave. We won’t understand what’s going on if we kill everything that moves."
"4","Flying Waters","14","4","Maelle","Look, a red tree. The Gestral village must be ahead."
"4","Flying Waters","14","5","Gustave","You know what Nevrons are capable of."
"4","Flying Waters","14","6","Lune","She’ll be fine."
"4","Flying Waters","14","7","Gustave","She’ll be fine."
"4","Flying Waters","15","0","Gustave","Still too far…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","1","Maelle","Being out here isn’t what I expected."
"4","Flying Waters","15","2","Gustave","As expected. Hey, you okay?"
"4","Flying Waters","15","3","Maelle","Death out here’s not like death in Lumière, is it? I– uh, I thought I was used to losing people. Like of a foster child, right? But not– not like that– on the beach… that man…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","4","Gustave","Yeah… yeah, I know… Neurons, we were prepared for, but not… And now, we finally found other survivors and it’s… You know, that’s… that’s the insidious thing about the Gommage. It’s predictable. Almost gentle. It makes Lumière complacent and accepting but… The Gommage is equally violent and death… Death is just as final."
"4","Flying Waters","15","5","Maelle","I’ve been having nightmares."
"4","Flying Waters","15","6","Gustave","Yeah, me too… Look, If death approaches, I want you to run. No, no, no. Promise me. Run. Especially if we meet the man from the beach. We can’t face him. You see him, you run."
"4","Flying Waters","15","7","Maelle","Only if you do the same."
"4","Flying Waters","15","8","Gustave","Oh, I’m running as soon as I see a strand of white hair. Trust me. You won’t even see me, I’m running so fast."
"4","Flying Waters","15","9","Maelle","Oh, please. You’re an old man, I can outrun you any day…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","10","Gustave","Yeah, right… There was a time when thirsty was young, you know…"
"4","Flying Waters","15","11","Maelle","Huh, sure…"
"4","Flying Waters","16","0","Maelle","Surprised to find you here."
"4","Flying Waters","16","1","Lune","I hope we can trust him."
"4","Flying Waters","16","2","Maelle","Well, at least, we can upgrade our Pictos."
"4","Flying Waters","17","0","narrator","The Curator offers you his services."
"4","Flying Waters","18","0","Maelle","Told you Gestrals were real!"
"4","Flying Waters","18","1","Gustave","You did not."
"4","Flying Waters","18","2","Maelle","Well, I thought it!"
"4","Flying Waters","19","0","Lune","How did the Gestrals survive out here?"
"4","Flying Waters","19","1","Gustave","I’m not sure."
"4","Flying Waters","19","2","Lune","I can’t wait to ask them. Gestrals!"
"4","Flying Waters","20","0","narrator","Gustave finds a spot where he can be alone. He spends some time writing in his journal. He writes about how the arm they created for him was incredibly useful against water type Nevrons. He hopes that one day, his apprentices will read everything he wrote."
"4","Flying Waters","21","0","Gustave","For those who come after."
"4","Flying Waters","22","0","Gustave","Been a long time since I’ve seen you play."
"4","Flying Waters","22","1","Lune","A Gestral village–"
"4","Flying Waters","22","2","Gustave","Yeah. I still can’t believe they exist. I mean, what other fairy tales are real?"
"4","Flying Waters","22","3","Lune","This is ultimately a war of information. But there’s still too much we don’t understand. Where the Paintress comes from? Why she does what she does? Who is she?? Seventy years and we still barely know anything."
"4","Flying Waters","22","4","Gustave","And the man on the beach. Yeah, too many unknowns. But, if we take down the Paintress, at least that gives future generations a chance to unravel the mystery."
"4","Flying Waters","22","5","Lune","You seem better than– before."
"4","Flying Waters","22","6","Gustave","Yeah? I’m holding it together?"
"4","Flying Waters","22","7","Lune","Mm."
"4","Flying Waters","22","8","Gustave","Shock’s worn off. A bit. We can’t bring anyone back. But I thought we can keep their spirit alive by pushing forward. And at least, there’s three of us now. The mission hasn’t changed."
"4","Flying Waters","22","9","Lune","Tomorrow comes."
"4","Flying Waters","22","10","Gustave","Tomorrow comes."
"4","Flying Waters","23","0","Lune","Did Noco tell you anything about the village, other than “red trees everywhere?”"
"4","Flying Waters","23","1","Maelle","Noco’s not great with specifics."
"4","Flying Waters","23","2","Gustave","We’ll just have to think like Gestrals then."
