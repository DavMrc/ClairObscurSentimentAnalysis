"15","Sirène","0","0","Lune","The architecture looks very different here."
"15","Sirène","0","1","Monoco","This kind of place never existed before the Fracture."
"15","Sirène","0","2","Sciel","It’s beautiful… Feels surreal…"
"15","Sirène","0","3","Lune","Is she the Axon?"
"15","Sirène","0","4","Monoco","Sirène. She Who Plays With Wonder."
"15","Sirène","0","5","Verso","Putain."
"15","Sirène","0","6","Maelle","Lune? What’s going on?"
"15","Sirène","0","7","Lune","I-I don’t know-"
"15","Sirène","0","8","Monoco","She’s manipulating your emotions! You have to focus. Remember why you’re here. Be careful. They call her She Who Plays with Wonder. But what she really does is play with your head."
"15","Sirène","0","9","Verso","Let’s move fast, before we all lose our minds."
"15","Sirène","1","0","Verso","Don’t look at her for too long or you’ll go insane. I’ve seen people jumping off a cliff just from looking at her…"
"15","Sirène","1","1","Lune","It is… Mesmerising."
"15","Sirène","1","2","Maelle","This dance feels familiar. Was this kind of dancing taught in Lumière?"
"15","Sirène","1","3","Sciel","I don’t think so, never seen it."
"15","Sirène","2","0","Maelle","This place is huge."
"15","Sirène","2","1","Verso","Thank Expedition 67 for destroying a lot of walls to get further. Couldn’t progress without that."
"15","Sirène","2","2","Lune","It feels like home."
"15","Sirène","3","0","Maelle","What’s THAT?"
"15","Sirène","3","1","Verso","The tisseur, it works for Sirène."
"15","Sirène","3","2","Lune","So he creates all of that for her."
"15","Sirène","3","3","Verso","We should take it out. It would definitely be an advantage against Sirène."
"15","Sirène","4","0","narrator","The Nevron does not seem hostile. It sews tirelessly, engrossed in its work. Attack anyway?"
"15","Sirène","5","0","Verso","Good job, no other expedition managed that."
"15","Sirène","5","1","Maelle","No other expedition had a Lumina converter."
"15","Sirène","5","2","Lune","Yet this victory feels hollow…"
"15","Sirène","6","0","Monoco","We’re finally there."
"15","Sirène","6","1","Verso","She’s waiting at the end of this tunnel."
"15","Sirène","6","2","Lune","Then we should prepare before we head there. She’s even grander than I thought."
"15","Sirène","6","3","Verso","Lune, you’re ok, right?"
"15","Sirène","6","4","Maelle","I swear I’ve seen this dance before."
"15","Sirène","7","0","Maelle","Is it… You again? Who are-"
"15","Sirène","7","1","Verso","Maelle?"
"15","Sirène","7","2","Lune","What did you see this time?"
"15","Sirène","7","3","Maelle","I-I don’t know. A- A woman. It was- Why do I keep seeing things? Who are you?"
"15","Sirène","8","0","Sciel","You seem preoccupied."
"15","Sirène","8","1","Verso","It’s nothing, just nerves."
"15","Sirène","8","2","Sciel","Hm."
"15","Sirène","8","3","Verso","It’s been a long road to get here."
"15","Sirène","8","4","Sciel","Extra long for you, I imagine."
"15","Sirène","8","5","Verso","You, on the other hand, seem quite relaxed."
"15","Sirène","8","6","Sciel","Do I?"
"15","Sirène","8","7","Verso","You’re not nervous?"
"15","Sirène","8","8","Sciel","Of course I am, but… We will do everything in our power. And either it will be enough, or it won’t."
"15","Sirène","8","9","Verso","Hmm."
"15","Sirène","9","0","Lune","I can’t believe we’re this close."
"15","Sirène","9","1","Verso","Yeah."
"15","Sirène","9","2","Lune","Thank you. Sciel was right about you."
"15","Sirène","9","3","Verso","Oh. Actually, I should thank you. I wouldn’t have got this far on my own."
"15","Sirène","9","4","Lune","Tomorrow comes."
"15","Sirène","10","0","Verso","Still thinking about what you saw?"
"15","Sirène","10","1","Maelle","I wish Gustave was here."
"15","Sirène","10","2","Verso","…"
"15","Sirène","11","0","Monoco","You’re finally here."
"15","Sirène","11","1","Verso","We are."
"15","Sirène","11","2","Monoco","You ready?"
"15","Sirène","11","3","Verso","Yeah."
"15","Sirène","12","0","Esquie","I miss Soarrie."
"15","Sirène","12","1","Verso","Me too."
"15","Sirène","12","2","Esquie","Did you know Soarrie was my FIRST rock?"
"15","Sirène","12","3","Verso","Really?"
"15","Sirène","12","4","Esquie","Mmmhmm. François was suuuuper jealous, but he got one from Clea instead."
"15","Sirène","12","5","Verso","Wait, François has his own set of rocks? Why does he keep stealing yours then?"
"15","Sirène","12","6","Esquie","Because we’re buddies! François is so fun."
"15","Sirène","13","0","narrator","Maelle finds a spot where she can write. She spends some time writing in Gustave’s journal, to honour his memory. She writes about how they can now enter the Monolith, and they should finally understand everything. She hopes Gustave’s apprentices will read this journal someday."
"15","Sirène","14","0","Sciel","We’ve done it."
"15","Sirène","14","1","Maelle","We’re really going to face the Paintress."
"15","Sirène","14","2","Lune","And finally break this cycle."
"15","Sirène","14","3","Sciel","That being said… Someone here has been hiding a terrible secret from us."
"15","Sirène","14","4","Lune","What are you talking about?"
"15","Sirène","14","5","Sciel","You thought we’d never find out, didn’t you? Nobody ever wondered what Esquie was made of, did they? Well, Esquie and I had a chat."
"15","Sirène","14","6","Esquie","I’m sorry, Verso! She promised me sweet rocks!"
"15","Sirène","14","7","Lune","What! Is that wine?"
"15","Sirène","14","8","Verso","I stored my personal stash inside him. All excellent vintages. I don’t normally share, but I suppose tonight deserves an exception."
"15","Sirène","14","9","Esquie","Mon ami, I told you to stop drinking alone."
"15","Sirène","14","10","Sciel","To your great generosity."
"15","Sirène","14","11","Maelle","I don’t know how you can like this."
"15","Sirène","14","12","Lune","It comes with age."
"15","Sirène","14","13","Maelle","Do you have apple juice?"
"15","Sirène","14","14","Verso","Yeah, I’ll, uh, I’ll leave you to it."
"15","Sirène","15","0","Verso","My beautiful sister doesn’t need this ugly mask."
"15","Sirène","15","1","Renoir","You embrace her, yet you’re condemning her to die."
"15","Sirène","15","2","Verso","You brought him here?!"
"15","Sirène","15","3","Renoir","I’m not here to fight. But my son, do you know what it means to disappear into nothingness? Have you thought through the consequences? Not just for you, or even me, but for them. Their memories, their dreams, their love for each other? Who really is the one painting death? And who paints life instead? We exist and we will exist for as long as she wants. You want to spoil what we’ve been given. Sometimes, we paint the bars of our own prison. Your despair blinds you. You think you’re ready to pay the price. But are you willing to let THEM pay the price for YOU?"
"15","Sirène","15","4","Renoir/Verso","May everything be decided before their very eyes. Between the bars of their prison."
"15","Sirène","15","5","Verso","In the shadow of the Monolith."
"15","Sirène","15","6","Renoir","In the shadow of the Monolith."
