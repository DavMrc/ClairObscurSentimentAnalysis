"21","The Reacher","0","0","narrator","Maelle asks Verso if they could talk by the lake. They walk there together."
"21","The Reacher","1","0","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","1","1","Maelle","I found the letter."
"21","The Reacher","1","2","Verso","What?"
"21","The Reacher","1","3","Maelle","From Alicia."
"21","The Reacher","1","4","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","1","5","Maelle","I need to see her. I want to talk to her. And understand…"
"21","The Reacher","1","6","Verso","Understand what?"
"21","The Reacher","1","7","Maelle","Why Maman…"
"21","The Reacher","1","8","Verso","What, kept her scars? No. Don’t go messing with her head, she doesn’t need that, and she doesn’t owe you any answers."
"21","The Reacher","1","9","Maelle","She’s the one who kept coming to me. I think she wants to see me."
"21","The Reacher","1","10","Verso","Just leave her be. Please."
"21","The Reacher","1","11","Maelle","Verso. You’re not doing her any favours. You already destroyed her world. Maybe I can help her. She doesn’t owe me, but… maybe I owe her."
"21","The Reacher","1","12","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","1","13","Maelle","And let’s not talk about what YOU owe her. Don’t you wanna see her too?"
"21","The Reacher","1","14","Verso","Yeah, of course. She doesn’t want to see me though. Not after everything."
"21","The Reacher","1","15","Maelle","Then she can throw us out and we’ll leave her alone."
"21","The Reacher","1","16","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","1","17","Maelle","Is that a yes?"
"21","The Reacher","1","18","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","1","19","Maelle","Great, where is she?"
"21","The Reacher","1","20","Verso","If I had to guess… There is a place she loves, at the top of the mountain near the Monolith. With the third Axon."
"21","The Reacher","1","21","Maelle","Oh. That Axon… I guess we’re climbing."
"21","The Reacher","2","0","narrator","Verso promised to take Maelle to his sister. She is most likely in a giant on the island of the last Axon, near the Monolith."
"21","The Reacher","3","0","Lune","Another Axon. How did it get so large?"
"21","The Reacher","3","1","Verso","She wasn’t always this tall. But she’s obsessed with reaching the stars, so…"
"21","The Reacher","3","2","Maelle","Papa and his parables."
"21","The Reacher","3","3","Verso","Parables?"
"21","The Reacher","3","4","Maelle","He never paints just to paint. Everything has to have layers and layers of meaning and purpose. Everything’s a lesson."
"21","The Reacher","3","5","Verso","Hmm."
"21","The Reacher","3","6","Lune","What’s the lesson with this one?"
"21","The Reacher","3","7","Maelle","Hope."
"21","The Reacher","3","8","Verso","Alici- My sister’s at the top."
"21","The Reacher","3","9","Maelle","And Papa knows I have vertigo."
"21","The Reacher","4","0","Sciel","Are they trying to fix things? Or break things?"
"21","The Reacher","4","1","Monoco","She Who Grasps The Sky. They’re jealous. They wish to destroy her work. Pull her back to the ground."
"21","The Reacher","4","2","Lune","Is this part of “the parable?”"
"21","The Reacher","4","3","Maelle","Everything is."
"21","The Reacher","5","0","Sciel","Did that Nevron just kick a different Nevron off the tower?"
"21","The Reacher","5","1","Verso","Looks that way."
"21","The Reacher","5","2","Maelle","(amused exasperation)"
"21","The Reacher","6","0","Maelle","Vertigo, remember? His intentions are good, I know… but his methods…"
"21","The Reacher","6","1","Lune","Your father?"
"21","The Reacher","6","2","Maelle","I’m the youngest, which makes everything worse."
"21","The Reacher","6","3","Lune","Oh, I understand that."
"21","The Reacher","6","4","Sciel","Only child."
"21","The Reacher","6","5","Maelle","Yeah. Clea’s the oldest. She’s just so… perfect. So… accomplished and talented. Papa’s favourite, he’s so proud of her. And Verso… Verso could always make Papa laugh. They had so many inside jokes. Then there’s me…"
"21","The Reacher","6","6","Verso","And then there’s you. The ACTUAL favourite. The one he calls his “hidden star,” but who’s too shy and self-conscious to see it."
"21","The Reacher","6","7","Maelle","Yet here I am, messing things up even more."
"21","The Reacher","6","8","Verso","Look around. He just wants you to fly."
"21","The Reacher","7","0","narrator","This Orphelin is different from the rest. It does not sabotage. It builds."
"21","The Reacher","8","0","Lune","All these inventions—Gustave would have loved to see this."
"21","The Reacher","9","0","Maelle","Hello."
"21","The Reacher","9","1","Verso","Alicia. Your letter…"
"21","The Reacher","9","2","Maelle","She blames us, doesn’t she? You didn’t deserve that… Oh. You’re the real Axon. You know Papa painted her? So you know who she represents. You… like? Being here? With her? I guess… this… represents his hope. For us. For me, then. Go. Claim your piece of sky. We both deserve to fly. Let me give you a new beginning."
"21","The Reacher","9","3","Verso","Alicia—"
"21","The Reacher","9","4","Alicia","Send me to my family."
"21","The Reacher","9","5","Verso","Wait—Maelle—!"
"21","The Reacher","10","0","narrator","At camp, Verso refuses to talk to anyone. He stands alone by the lake. After a while, Maelle decides to go and talk to him."
"21","The Reacher","11","0","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","1","Maelle","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","2","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","3","Maelle","I’m sorry."
"21","The Reacher","11","4","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","5","Maelle","It’s what she wanted. I owed her that much. We owed her that much."
"21","The Reacher","11","6","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","7","Maelle","I honoured her wishes. That’s something neither you nor Renoir ever did. And not Maman either."
"21","The Reacher","11","8","Verso","… I didn’t get to say goodbye. You didn’t wait. You didn’t give me a chance to persuade her."
"21","The Reacher","11","9","Maelle","She knew what she wanted. You wouldn’t have been able to sway her."
"21","The Reacher","11","10","Verso","She’s not you. You don’t know that. I know her better than you do. But you didn’t even give me the chance to try. You just erased her."
"21","The Reacher","11","11","Maelle","Verso…"
"21","The Reacher","11","12","Verso","You’ve lost two brothers. You know what it’s like to lose your sibling and never get the chance to say goodbye."
"21","The Reacher","11","13","Maelle","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","14","Verso","You Painters. You just do what you want, you don’t care how it affects the rest of us."
"21","The Reacher","11","15","Maelle","I do care. I know you’re hurting, but the person who made that decision wasn’t me. It was her. It would have been wrong to deny her just so you could try and talk her out of her decision."
"21","The Reacher","11","16","Verso","She’s the last of my family. I have no one left now."
"21","The Reacher","11","17","Maelle","You have me. You have us."
"21","The Reacher","11","18","Verso","Maelle. I wasn’t ready."
"21","The Reacher","11","19","Maelle","I don’t understand. You were ready when you set Papa free. You expected that he would erase the Canvas and everyone in it. Isn’t that the same thing?"
"21","The Reacher","11","20","Verso","It’s different. It’s different. Why did she do that?"
"21","The Reacher","11","21","Maelle","You know why."
"21","The Reacher","11","22","Verso","…"
"21","The Reacher","11","23","Maelle","But you’re right. I should have thought of you. I should have given you a chance to say goodbye. I’m truly sorry, Verso."
"21","The Reacher","11","24","Verso","… At least she’s free now."
"21","The Reacher","12","0","narrator","Despite his frustration, Verso understands Maelle’s words. He appreciates that Maelle is honest with him and Maelle empathises deeply with Verso. Maelle and Verso feel closer to each other. They sit in silence a little longer. This time, Maelle comforts Verso. They head back to the others."
