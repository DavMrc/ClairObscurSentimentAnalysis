"26","Endless Tower","0","0","Verso","That’s where she used to paint… And create…"
"26","Endless Tower","0","1","Maelle","Yeah…"
"26","Endless Tower","0","2","Monoco","A proper challenge."
"26","Endless Tower","1","0","Fading woman","Alicia. I must say, you’ve surprised me. I didn’t expect you and… your friends to succeed. And I certainly didn’t expect the doppelganger to pull you into his schemes. He was supposed to keep an eye on you, not recruit you. But you did well. All that’s left is for Renoir to clean up the Canvas."
"26","Endless Tower","1","1","Maelle","How can you let him erase Verso’s Canvas?"
"26","Endless Tower","1","2","Fading woman","Alicia, don’t be emotional. You know this is necessary. And spare me that drivel of how much this Canvas means to you. I’ve spent far more time here than you. I painted half this world with Verso. We went on adventures here while you sat reading in your room. I was perfectly fine leaving Maman here to work out her sorrows. And if you insist on staying too, well, that’s your choice. But Renoir will not stand for it. And I need him to help me with the real conflict outside. Not waste more of his time in here. Enough. I grow tired repeating myself. Renoir will do what needs to be done. Why don’t we have some fun instead?"
"26","Endless Tower","1","3","Maelle","I could use some fun."
"26","Endless Tower","1","4","Fading woman","Good. I’ll show you what you missed out on, all those years hiding in your room. It’s a game Verso and I used to play. I’ve sketched some figures. Doodles, really. I believe your friends call them “Nevrons.” It’s a creative name. I like it. Verso and I named this challenge, The Gauntlet. Survive them all, and I’ll show you a true drawing. Come on Alicia, have some fun. The Gauntlet lies within this Canvas. Don’t worry, death in there isn’t final. Every Canvas has its own rules. And I find death a boring outcome. Don’t you, Alicia?"
"26","Endless Tower","2","0","Fading woman","Not bad. I’m impressed. Did you have fun?"
"26","Endless Tower","2","1","Maelle","Yes."
"26","Endless Tower","2","2","Fading woman","Good. It’s about time. Some advice. Don’t let yourself get caught up in other people’s drama. Neither of them are adult enough for the conversation they need to have. Until they’ve faced their grief, they’re better apart than together. But instead, they do… this. And pull others into their mess. Like you. Trapped in Aline’s delusion. And before you call me a hypocrite, yes, I did get involved. I gave Renoir the edge he needed. Otherwise she would have overpowered him long ago. She is, after all, the stronger Painter. But there’s a difference between helping and getting sucked in. This is not your battle. Don’t let their mess become yours. Aline would rather lose herself in make-believe than face reality. It’s a drug she’s unwilling to resist. Don’t make the same mistake. And Renoir… he’s terrified of losing more family. And his response is to try to bend everyone to his will. Don’t let his fear end up controlling you. It’s not selfish to make your own choices, sister. You’ve made great strides since I saw you last. Don’t go backwards. Take this. A reminder that you control your life. And if you’re not having fun… do something else. I hope you had fun. Just remember… The only thing you owe them, is to live a life you enjoy."
