"11","Monoco’s Station","0","0","Verso","Follow the tracks, they’ll lead us to Monoco."
"11","Monoco’s Station","0","1","Maelle","A train. Gustave would have liked to see that."
"11","Monoco’s Station","0","2","Lune","Is it true, before the Fracture, Lumière had trains running throughout the continent?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","0","3","Verso","Always running late, but running, yes."
"11","Monoco’s Station","1","0","Verso","Here we are. Monoco’s Station."
"11","Monoco’s Station","1","1","Lune","Is that a Grandis? I knew it! They’re real too!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","1","2","Grandis Guard","Contrary to what some believe, guard duty is quite rewarding. I find it meditative and instructional."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","0","Verso","If Monoco’s not here, that means– Slow as ever, mon vieux."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","1","Monoco","Your reflexes remain sharp as ever. I approve."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","2","Esquie","MOMO!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","3","Monoco","Esquie! Did Verso pull you into another adventure? Mmm. New friends?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","4","Lune","You speak our language?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","5","Verso","We had a lot of time to kill, so I taught him."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","6","Monoco","Ladies. Could I OW– interest you in a duel?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","7","Maelle","Yep, definitely a Gestral."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","8","Verso","No point trying to talk until we’ve calmed Monoco down with a “relaxing” fight. Be careful though, Monoco’s fighting style is a bit… peculiar."
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","0","Noco","Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! NEVRON!! Oh, hi."
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","1","Monoco","No distractions, son! I’m really busy beating up strangers."
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","2","Maelle","Noco! What’re you doing here?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","3","Noco","Even with Esquie, you’re still so slow! Oh! Where’s the man with the weird arm?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","4","Verso","Uh. Noco, you said Nevron?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","5","Noco","Oh, yeah! A Stalact is approaching! The Grandis are taking cover. Come on, come on!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","3","6","Monoco","Oh. Hm. A Stalact."
"11","Monoco’s Station","4","0","Monoco","Friends of Verso. As “Honoured Guests,” the first fight is yours! Defeat the Stalact with your fearsome talents!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","4","1","Sciel","Right. Oh. You’re serious."
"11","Monoco’s Station","4","2","Verso","Yes, he is. You little coward."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","0","Monoco","You’ve found worthy friends, Verso."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","1","Verso","Jealous?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","2","Sciel","What are you doing?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","3","Monoco","I just need… the foot. Ahah!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","4","Verso","He transforms by collecting Nevron feet. Don’t ask me how it works, I’ve never understood."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","5","Monoco","Now that we’ve had some good battles to warm the spirits, to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","6","Verso","We are heading for Old Lumière."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","7","Monoco","Ok, bye."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","8","Verso","Hey, come on. Hey! Hey, look, I know we failed before, but– Look, you doofus, don’t you recognize her?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","9","Monoco","Of course, I do–"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","10","Verso","Then you know what that means. This our shot, it might be our only shot."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","11","Monoco","This is YOUR only shot. Out of question. I will never join you again."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","12","Verso","There will be a lot of fighting though."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","13","Monoco","Oh yeah, that’s true."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","14","Verso","Yeah, that’s true."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","15","Monoco","There will be a lot of fighting."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","16","Verso","Exactly."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","17","Monoco","Count me in then."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","18","Verso","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","19","Monoco","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","20","Verso","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","21","Monoco","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","22","Verso","Yes, good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","23","Maelle","Noco’s coming too."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","24","Verso","You are???"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","25","Noco","Not a lot of merchants go to Old Lumière! There will be tons of rare shiny treasure and then I shall be– THE UNDISPUTED. TOP. MERCHANT. IN THE WORLD!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","26","Monoco","As a responsible parent, this is a superb idea. Let us go. To Old Lumière."
"11","Monoco’s Station","6","0","Noco","Oh, the Grandis came out now that the Stalact is gone! You should go talk to them, they’re nicer than Gestrals. If you want to go to Old Lymière, you should take this exit then head north."
"11","Monoco’s Station","7","0","Grandis Cleaner 1","I can clear the snow and I can clear the rubble, but this is too much."
"11","Monoco’s Station","7","1","Grandis Cleaner 2","Must we truly dispose of this thing? It does not obstruct the way. It is simply… there."
"11","Monoco’s Station","8","0","Grandis Historian","As some of us forget the history of our people, I thought it prudent to begin recording what I can."
"11","Monoco’s Station","8","1","Lune","That is great to hear. Do you write, then?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","8","2","Grandis Historian","No, no. I record everything in my mind. If someone forgets our history, I will simply tell them!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","8","3","Lune","But what if you forget?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","8","4","Grandis Historian","Let me think on that."
"11","Monoco’s Station","9","0","Grandis Sculptor","I remember sculpting this statue. I must say… looking back now… Why did we all sculpt the same thing?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","9","1","Grandis Historian","Do you not remember? There was a time when the tribes sought to compete in a different manner than through eloquence battles. So we did this."
"11","Monoco’s Station","10","0","Grandis Scout 1","It was pleasant meeting the merchant, but things could have become perilous. We did well to return."
"11","Monoco’s Station","10","1","Grandis Scout 2","There is too much we do not know about the crater. The Nevrons there are fierce."
"11","Monoco’s Station","11","0","Grandis","Beautiful weather today, mm? Albeit a tad warm for my liking."
"11","Monoco’s Station","11","1","Lune","Too warm? Really?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","11","2","Grandis","Before the Fracture, our ancestral home lay high above the heavens, on mountains tipped with crystal clouds. Blossoms of snowflakes graced our every breath. The blizzards of yesteryear were a sight to behold… and quite invigorating to experience."
"11","Monoco’s Station","12","0","Amazed Grandis","It is true, the Fracture brought its share of ills, but there is beauty in its aftermath. Take these stations, scattered across the mountains. Though not their original purpose, they have sheltered us well and become our cherished home. Your ancestors rode iron horses from station to station. And though these marvels breathe fire no more, still, they are a lovely reminder of human ingenuity and they beautify our surrounds. It is astonishing, is it not? The many wonders your ancestors have wrought."
"11","Monoco’s Station","12","1","Lune","I think you would enjoy a visit to Lumière."
"11","Monoco’s Station","12","2","Amazed Grandis","Oh yes. I would very much love to go to Lumière one day."
"11","Monoco’s Station","13","0","Grumpy Grandis","The Grandis lived peaceful lives long before the Paintress emerged. The three great Grandis tribes were renowned for the artistry of their discourse. We too once had grand arenas, like the Grestrals. But within our arenas, eloquence landed the killing blows. I still remember the excitement of the Oratory Games. Every four years, the greatest minds came together to demonstrate their mastery over the spoken word. The debates were fierce and lengthy. I recall one bout that lasted 96 hours!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","13","1","Lune","Do you still hold these Games?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","13","2","Grumpy Grandis","Not as they once were, for the Three great Grandis tribes no longer exist. We are all that remain. But the Games were not simply a competition between us. They were a celebration and a chance to come together. And that spirit we continue to honour. These days, our debates are more humble in nature, but that allows for a more intimate competitive environment. We have faced many challenges since the Fracture, but our traditions live on, in one form or another."
"11","Monoco’s Station","14","0","Arguing Grandis","Would you kindly descend from there?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","14","1","Troublesome Grandis","No."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","0","Grandis","I should… build a proper bridge one of these days."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","1","Grandis","Some think to fight back, to strike directly against the Nevrons in open battle. Though we are strangers to the mindset of war and outmatched in strength and numbers. We have the will, but have we the way?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","2","Lune","I don’t know, but the only chance you have is if you stand together."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","3","Grandis","In that, we agree. But do we stand and fight together? Or do we retreat and flee together? Perhaps it is time to find a new home."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","4","Grandis","Many challenges lie ahead, for both your kind and ours. Please. Take this."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","5","Young Grandis","I can’t remember a time when we weren’t hiding from the Nevrons."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","6","Old Grandis","Feels like only yesterday to me."
"11","Monoco’s Station","15","7","Grandis Scout 1","This pathway leads to the treacherous region of the mountains. If your destination is Old Lumière, you should leave via the other exit."
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","0","Sciel","Monoco seems fun."
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","1","Verso","Oh, yeah."
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","2","Sciel","Bet you guys got up to lots of trouble together."
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","3","Verso","That obvious, huh?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","4","Sciel","You guys getting us into more trouble now?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","5","Verso","An appropriate amount of trouble."
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","6","Sciel","Mmm. I’ve spent some time with Gestrals. I’m not sure we have the same definition of “appropriate.”"
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","7","Verso","Ahhh, let me guess, you’ve been to one of their arenas?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","8","Sciel","Reigning Champion, naturally."
"11","Monoco’s Station","16","9","Verso","Naturally."
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","0","Lune","Feet? Really?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","1","Verso","Don’t worry, he’s not interested in human feet."
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","2","Lune","… And the bell?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","3","Verso","Gift from the Grandis."
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","4","Lune","Amazing. I wonder if we can achieve something similar…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","5","Verso","I’ll stick to my swords. I’m not too keen on turning into a Nevron."
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","6","Lune","If we combine this with Pictos, could we selectively use Nevron abilities in battle-"
"11","Monoco’s Station","17","7","Verso","Okay, you seem busy. I’ll come back later."
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","0","Maelle","The Grandis are so gentle, who’s going to protect them while Monoco’s gone?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","1","Verso","They can take care of themselves."
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","2","Maelle","Really?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","3","Verso","They’ve got their bells. Don’t worry."
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","4","Maelle","What do the bells do?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","5","Verso","Ringing the bells makes the Nevrons flee. Although… it only works on Nevrons with ears, so not every Nevron…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","6","Maelle","Well, now I’m worried."
"11","Monoco’s Station","18","7","Verso","Yeah, actually me too."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","0","Noco","Did you get my present?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","1","Verso","What present?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","2","Noco","The one I left in your hut! I took a special detour through Ancient Sanctuary just for you."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","3","Verso","Oh, I got your note about- But I didn’t see a present? What was it?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","4","Noco","Hrmph! You’ll just have to wait and find out. But it’s SUPER cool."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","5","Verso","Silly patate. Thanks. How’s my favourite patate?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","6","Noco","Hmph. How’s my favourite NOT-a-patate?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","7","Verso","Oh, I’m still your favourite, am I? ‘Cause you’ve taken a real shine to Maelle."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","8","Noco","Oooooh, jealous?? You’re the one who asked me to make friends!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","9","Verso","Fair enough. So, tell me, patate to NOT-a-patate, why are you tagging along? Really."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","10","Noco","What d’you mean? If I’m gonna be the GREATEST. MERCHANT. OF ALL TIME then I need to find some TREASURE."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","11","Verso","I don’t believe you. Don’t tell Monoco I said this, but you were and still are the greatest SEARCHER of all time. And you know there are more Lost Gestrals out there. Why be a merchant? Why go to Old Lumière?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","12","Noco","Meh."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","13","Verso","MEH??"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","14","Noco","Lotsa other Searcher now. Just ‘cause I’m the GREATEST OF ALL TIME doesn’t mean I wanna do it forever."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","15","Verso","No?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","16","Noco","You know this. Forever the same SUCKS."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","17","Verso","Mmmm, true."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","18","Noco","See?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","19","Verso","All right, all right."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","20","Noco","Besides, I need to keep Monoco out of trouble."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","21","Verso","Monoco’s all grown up now, and it’s your turn to be the patate."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","22","Noco","Meh."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","23","Verso","So eloquent."
"11","Monoco’s Station","19","24","Noco","(mischievous laugh)"
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","0","Monoco","Is Golgra still mad at me?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","1","Verso","What do you think?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","2","Monoco","Ehhhh. Well, Golgra helped Noco start his merchant shop…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","3","Verso","Yeah, but defying Golgra wasn’t Noco’s idea, was it?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","4","Monoco","Noco would’ve done the same for me."
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","5","Verso","Noco would’ve got Golgra on his side first."
"11","Monoco’s Station","20","6","Monoco","Bah. It’s been ten years! Golgra needs to get over it."
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","0","Esquie","Ok. Momo is Momo and Nono is Nono."
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","1","Verso","Uh.."
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","2","Esquie","Then we’ve got Lulu, Maemae, and Scisci…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","3","Verso","Eh… I don’t think they’ll like that-"
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","4","Esquie","You sure you don’t wanna be Verver?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","5","Verso","Positive."
"11","Monoco’s Station","21","6","Esquie","(blows a raspberry)"
"11","Monoco’s Station","22","0","narrator","Maelle finds a spot where she can write. She spends some time writing in Gustave’s journal, to honour his memory. She writes about their encounter with Monoco and how exciting it is to travel with a Gestral. She hopes Gustave’s apprentices will read this journal someday."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","0","Monoco","You see, there was a Stalact and I smashed it, utterly destroyed it. I did it in two attacks, plenty of damage. There was nothing left. And then there was a giant Pélerin that attacked. It was tough, but I defeated it no problem."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","1","Verso","Pèlerins are weak. I could have done that blindfolded."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","2","Monoco","This expedition is gloomy."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","3","Verso","Yeah. They lost a lot of friends, and they just buried another. Grieving takes time."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","4","Monoco","How ‘bout a little “Verso magic” to lighten the mood."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","5","Verso","You mean the one that hurts like hell?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","6","Monoco","Yes, I mean the one that hurts like hell."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","7","Verso","All right, all right, I’ll do it."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","8","Verso","Hi."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","9","Maelle","Not now, please, I’m working."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","10","Verso","Hi."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","11","Lune","Oh, Verso, there you are. How did- Ah! Fuck!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","12","Sciel","Oh my- Wow-"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","13","Maelle","What is that-"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","14","Verso","Hi. I’m a pair of legs that can talk."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","15","Lune","Verso?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","16","Verso","We’re both Verso."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","17","Maelle","You are so ridiculous."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","18","Lune","Wait. How can your legs talk?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","19","Verso","Ah, yes, I’m quite proud of that. Took a lot of training."
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","20","Sciel","Does it- does it hurt?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","21","Verso","Ahhh-ah-ah-ah! No, it doesn’t!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","22","Maelle","Did you cut yourself in half? Did Monoco cut you in half?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","23","Lune","Do you heal from the top or the bottom? Or do you have to bring the halves together? Hey, can you control the process?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","24","Sciel","So if you’re cut in half, does that mean you can be in two places at once? Can you go scouting with Monoco with your lower body while your upper body stays here and talks to us?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","25","Verso","Well, yeah, you see, I can go hunt Nevrons with my top half, while my bottom remains here cooking meals. Back in the days, that’s what I used to do…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","26","Lune","Can I- Are you? Huh?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","27","Verso","Yeah, my hair is…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","23","28","Monoco","All that pain just to put a smile on their faces. Verso, aren’t you getting too attached?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","24","0","narrator","Maelle stares at the stars. Sciel joins her in silence. They sit together for a while, watching the sky above."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","0","Maelle","Can you teach me to fight better?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","1","Sciel","Better?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","2","Maelle","That white-haired bastard hit us before we even knew he was there. I want to be ready next time. And you’re the best fighter I know."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","3","Sciel","High praise."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","4","Maelle","We both know they’ll come back. I want to strike first."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","5","Sciel","Emotions are powerful. But if you let them take control, they’ll work against you."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","6","Maelle","I get that."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","7","Sciel","Alright then. First lesson. You need to see. Truly see. Your eyes tell the truth, but your mind? It can lie."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","8","Maelle","How?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","9","Sciel","Emotions distort perception. You’ll miss details. Lock onto the wrong thing. Or see what you"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","10","Sciel","want"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","11","Sciel","to see."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","12","Maelle","So what do I do?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","13","Sciel","See things as they are. Not as you fear them, not as you wish they’d be. Study your opponent—how they move, how they react. Understand them so you can anticipate, adjust, survive."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","14","Maelle","Hm."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","15","Sciel","In battle, it’s just you, your weapon, and your enemy. You need to understand all three. Everyone has blind spots. So ask yourself—every day—what’s yours? What’s theirs?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","16","Maelle","I thought this would be more… I dunno, technique."
"11","Monoco’s Station","25","17","Sciel","…"
"11","Monoco’s Station","26","0","narrator","Maelle and Sciel continue training together under the stars. A quiet bond strengthens between them."
