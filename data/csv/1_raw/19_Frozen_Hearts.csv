"19","Frozen Hearts","0","4","Gestral","A mountain of ice, invaded by fire. Neurons often resemble their environment. So… Where did their fire come from? And what are those creatures at the top of the mountain?"

"19","Frozen Hearts","5","0","Monoco","So. How are you going to win back their trust?"
"19","Frozen Hearts","5","1","Verso","You’re really enjoying this, aren’t you?"
"19","Frozen Hearts","5","2","Monoco","Can’t rely on good hair and charm anymore. So what’s the plan?"
"19","Frozen Hearts","5","3","Verso","…"
