"25","Painting Workshop","0","0","Faceless boy","A traveller here. Bathing in light. I have whispered my fears, yet she merely smiles, a secretive smile that hints at truths beyond my grasp. She tells me the night must be met with courage, that the heart must not falter. She crafts a beast, radiant yet fearsome, woven from the very essence of luminescence. It prowls the night, casting its spectral glow upon the darkened corners of my sanctuary. Will you put an end to her night?"

"25","Painting Workshop","4","0","Faceless boy","A sister’s brush, a stroke of fear. The monster she painted… it lives in my night. Jealousy twists and love blinds. Her canvas conjured a nightmare, a creature to keep me awake. We must unmake what she created. For it does not belong here. Will you help me?"
"25","Painting Workshop","4","1","Lune","We will."
"25","Painting Workshop","4","2","Faceless boy","Seek the light within the dark. Her mind is a maze of twisted paths, but her heart knows the way. Farewell."
