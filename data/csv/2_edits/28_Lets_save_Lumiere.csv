"28","Let’s save Lumière","0","0","Maelle","Wait for us here. It’s dangerous for you near Papa. We’ll have to move fast, I can’t maintain them for very long. Tomorrow comes."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","3","1","Verso","Your father. He’s at the tower."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","3","2","Maelle","Yes."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","3","3","Lune","Maelle…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","2","Sciel","Your father’s been extra inspired."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","3","Monoco","A most enticing challenge."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","4","Maelle","Papa’s over there. And the chroma we need to bring back Lumière."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","5","Sciel","Even I can sense him…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","7","6","Lune","We’d better make sure we’re ready."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","0","Maelle","Papa."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","1","Renoir","Alicia."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","2","Maelle","Please. I just want you to understand what this Canvas means to me-"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","3","Renoir","I do understand. I know how powerful and intoxicating it is, how deeply attached we can become to the worlds we pour our hearts and souls into. I was enthralled and it nearly killed me."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","4","Maelle","That doesn’t mean you have to erase Verso’s Canvas!"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","5","Renoir","Child, do you think I want to? After all the sorrows we’ve endured, do you really think that I want to destroy that last piece of his soul?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","6","Maelle","Then don’t. Don’t."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","7","Renoir","Life keeps forcing cruel choices. We do what we must."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","8","Sciel","Grief often blinds us. And we make choices we can never take back."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","9","Renoir","You grieve for two."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","10","Sciel","I grieve for many."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","11","Lune","The choices of parents leave indelible marks upon their children. But ultimately, the voices in their head have to be their own. You cannot set the boundaries of their life for them."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","12","Maelle","After the fire—You wanted me to find—new joy in life. And I tried. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t. Verso died because of ME. How do I get from that to joy?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","13","Renoir","Child, it will get better. I promise you. But this is not the way. Your friends speak truth, and it changes nothing. You can hate me, but that’s a choice I must make. As your father, I must look out for you. Especially when you can’t look out for yourself."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","14","Maelle","You treat me as if I’m still five…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","8","15","Renoir","I treat you as if the shadow from the worst day of our lives is going to suffocate you and take you from us too. Enough. I said enough."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","1","Monoco","I do love a challenge, but this is beginning to irk me."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","2","Lune","Fuck. He keeps regenerating."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","3","Sciel","Maybe we focus on the Axons first?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","4","Maelle","(gasp)"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","5","Verso","No! She can’t-"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","6","Maelle","Maman??"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","9","7","Renoir","Aline, you’re going to kill yourself? It’s too soon for you to return to any Canvas! Aline! Look at Alicia. She can’t be here! Aline, it’s supposed to be you and me, not you AGAINST me."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","0","Renoir","Ironic. Your mother was the one who saved me, when I lost myself in a Canvas. She—She taught me how to safely use our gift, how to soar without flying too close to the sun. We—We Painted hundreds of Canvas worlds, pushing the very boundaries of creation. And she never let me forget that every day we spend here has a price. Yet—(cough) Yet here we are now."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","1","Maelle","So trust her. If she’s doing this, then—"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","2","Renoir","I trust what she taught me. This is not a game! You think you know what’s at stake, but you don’t!"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","3","Maelle","I know precisely what’s at stake! You want control, you want to feel like you’re doing something. You couldn’t save Verso, so you want to save us. Except you’re not. Destroying the Canvas won’t help us move on, it’ll just deny us the one place that helped us feel again."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","4","Renoir","67 years. 67 years, I spent trapped within the Monolith. But I persisted. I persisted. Do you know why? Do you know why I CANNOT leave her or you behind? This is what I see every day. I cannot spend another day with living corpses. Since the fire, our family has crumbled. Aline in the Canvas. Clea fighting her solitary war. You, a living ghost. Verso’s death broke us. I want it to be fixed. I need it to be fixed—I—(cough). I cannot lose you too."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","5","Maelle","Don’t you see?? That’s how I feel about them! I can’t lose them either. I’ve lost too much. Papa, see. I’ve lost so much."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","6","Renoir","We’ve both lost so much."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","7","Maelle","Papa. I don’t want to lose you either. I’m not leaving you forever. Just a little longer."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","8","Renoir","I want to trust you, but…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","9","Maelle","You can."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","10","Renoir","I’ll keep the light on for you. I hope you find peace. Hold onto each other."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","11","Lune","Verso…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","10","12","Verso","I’m sorry."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","0","Verso","Hi. You’re tired of painting, aren’t you? I’m tired too…"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","1","Maelle","That’s—Oh. You shouldn’t be able to be here."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","2","Verso","Maman’s gift."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","3","Maelle","Why did you run in? It’s dangerous for you here."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","4","Verso","“See things as they are, not how you want them to be.”"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","5","Maelle","What?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","6","Verso","You lied. To your father."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","7","Maelle","No, I—"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","8","Verso","He saw it too. But he wanted to believe. You’re going to die here. Why don’t you just leave? You can always come back."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","9","Maelle","The moment I leave, Papa will erase this canvas."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","10","Verso","This is not worth your life."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","11","Maelle","What life? My life of loneliness in a shell of a body? With no voice and no future?"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","12","Verso","You’re Maelle, no matter where you are. You don’t need this canvas."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","13","Maelle","But everything I want is here. Here I have a chance to live, Verso. To live. Out there, I merely exist."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","14","Verso","“Life keeps forcing cruel choices.”"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","15","Maelle","Stop quoting Papa!"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","16","Verso","It’s time to stop Painting."
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","17","Maelle","Verso… Papa also said, “Hold onto each other.”"
"28","Let’s save Lumière","11","18","Verso","I’m sorry."
