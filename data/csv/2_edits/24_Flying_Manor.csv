"24","Flying Manor","0","0","Verso","This is where she lived."
"24","Flying Manor","0","1","Maelle","Hmm."
"24","Flying Manor","1","0","Young boy","(gibberish) You are… You are here…"
"24","Flying Manor","1","1","Lune","What is this place?"
"24","Flying Manor","1","2","Young boy","(gibberish) It’s… her home. Here, in this canvas. We used to play here a lot… with the others… But now the one here… She is not her. She will never be. And she knows that."
"24","Flying Manor","1","3","Lune","Who are you talking about?"
"24","Flying Manor","1","4","Young boy","(gibberish) Everything is always about her… About her painting, her sculpting… Everything has to be perfect, but perfect I have never been. And perfect she is not, the one who is here now. Maybe… Maybe it’s better to forget about all of this… But she is trapped here, behind this door, in her atelier. Forever painting…"
"24","Flying Manor","1","5","Lune","How do we open the door behind you?"
"24","Flying Manor","1","6","Young boy","(gibberish) The colours… Bring back the colour to her paintings. She mocked Aline’s creation, trapped by her own paintings. Her Navrons stole her colours. If you could find them and unpaint them, then maybe… Maybe she will be free."
"24","Flying Manor","2","0","Young boy","(gibberish) You have conquered your foe, once again… Should I take you back to the plaza?"
"24","Flying Manor","2","1","Lune","We are back here…"
"24","Flying Manor","2","2","Young boy","(gibberish) You… You did it… You can go in her atelier now… But… She might not recognize you, for her soul is long gone. Don’t let her unpaint you. That’s not.. What she would have wanted…"
"24","Flying Manor","4","0","Verso","It can’t be…"
"24","Flying Manor","4","1","Maelle","Verso…"
"24","Flying Manor","4","2","Verso","Clea… You’re alive? What happened to her?"
"24","Flying Manor","4","3","Maelle","I bet Clea hated Maman’s portrait of her. So she painted over her."
"24","Flying Manor","4","4","Lune","And now she paints… Nevrons."
"24","Flying Manor","4","5","Verso","Can you heal her? Can you change her back?"
"24","Flying Manor","4","6","Maelle","I can’t repaint her, Clea’s the only one skilled enough to paint over someone else’s creation."
"24","Flying Manor","4","7","Verso","I don’t like this…"
"24","Flying Manor","4","8","Lune","This is going to be tough."
"24","Flying Manor","5","0","Sciel","How is she so strong?"
"24","Flying Manor","5","1","Maelle","She’s Clea’s creation."
"24","Flying Manor","5","2","Verso","Clea. No, no, no, no, wait…"
"24","Flying Manor","5","3","Maelle","She’s trying to find a way out."
"24","Flying Manor","5","4","Verso","I’m sorry."
"24","Flying Manor","6","0","Young boy","(gibberish) Have you… Laid her to rest?"
"24","Flying Manor","6","1","Lune","She did that by herself."
"24","Flying Manor","6","2","Young boy","(gibberish) Thank you… She… That’s what she wanted. I wish… I wish she would have listened to me. Then she wouldn’t have to make this painting suffer. Painting or not, she had feelings, and a soul. That’s what I think, at least, but I know she thinks differently. For me, everything in this canvas is as much alive as what is outside. Esquie, the Gestrals, the Grandis, even Aline’s paintings. I welcome them all. Painting should be a celebration. Just like music… Thank you for taking care of her. It may not be much, but would you accept a gift from me? A garment we had designed together. I can make only one. Who should have it? Wonderful. Here, have this. Thank you. For everything. Take care of yourself, and of the paintings around you."
"24","Flying Manor","8","0","Sciel","Esquie?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","1","Esquie","Hm?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","2","Sciel","…"
"24","Flying Manor","8","3","Esquie","Are you troubled, mon amie?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","4","Sciel","When we first met, what did you mean by “my terrible swimmer friend?”"
"24","Flying Manor","8","5","Esquie","Hm? I didn’t say that."
"24","Flying Manor","8","6","Sciel","I remember it quite clearly."
"24","Flying Manor","8","7","Esquie","Oh, you mean the second time we met."
"24","Flying Manor","8","8","Sciel","What?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","9","Esquie","In the caves? Yeah."
"24","Flying Manor","8","10","Sciel","Sorry, I’m- I’m quite lost."
"24","Flying Manor","8","11","Esquie","Oh yeah, me too. It’s fun."
"24","Flying Manor","8","12","Sciel","What do you mean by “second time?”"
"24","Flying Manor","8","13","Esquie","First means number one. Second means number two."
"24","Flying Manor","8","14","Sciel","Um. Yes, I understand that. So was I- was I swimming the first time we met?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","15","Esquie","Yes, you were. Before you stopped swimming in the middle of the ocean. That’s dangerous!"
"24","Flying Manor","8","16","Sciel","It was you. You saved me. Back then. Wait, but how?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","17","Esquie","I heard your tears."
"24","Flying Manor","8","18","Sciel","From so far away?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","19","Esquie","I heard you, so I came."
"24","Flying Manor","8","20","Sciel","Oh, I see."
"24","Flying Manor","8","21","Esquie","Ohoho."
"24","Flying Manor","8","22","Sciel","I… uh… Thank you…"
"24","Flying Manor","8","23","Esquie","Tears again. You sure do like to cry."
"24","Flying Manor","8","24","Sciel","I guess I do."
"24","Flying Manor","8","25","Esquie","Verso likes crying too."
"24","Flying Manor","8","26","Sciel","Yes, I know…"
"24","Flying Manor","8","27","Esquie","Hehehe. You were looking for someone then. Did you find them?"
"24","Flying Manor","8","28","Sciel","Um. No. But hopefully soon."
"24","Flying Manor","8","29","Esquie","Mmm. Yeah. I get sad too, when I lose my stones. But I always find them again. You will find them again too."
"24","Flying Manor","8","30","Sciel","You’re the best, mon ami."
"24","Flying Manor","10","0","Lune","What will you do, when this is all over? I’m having trouble imagining you living a “normal” life in Lumière."
"24","Flying Manor","10","1","Verso","Yeah, I’m not sure I can live in a city anymore. I don’t know. What about you?"
"24","Flying Manor","10","2","Lune","Well, Since we mere mortals can’t leave this Canvas, Maelle has kindly offered to Paint the outside world for me. So I can see."
"24","Flying Manor","10","3","Verso","Do you mean…"
"24","Flying Manor","10","4","Lune","A Painting inside this Painting."
