"3","Spring Meadows","0","0","Lune","You do that, we both die. Hey. Fucking hell. Wake up, Gustave."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","1","Gustave","Lune– The others–"
"3","Spring Meadows","0","2","Lune","I know. We’re the only ones left. You don’t get to die."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","3","Gustave","It’s just a matter of time, before we– “We’re already dead.” Look around– Look– Look–"
"3","Spring Meadows","0","4","Lune","This is not a foregone conclusion. “When one falls, we continue.” GET UP. We need to find a safer place, there are Nevrons around."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","5","Gustave","Lucien– I couldn’t–"
"3","Spring Meadows","0","6","Lune","This is not the place… The Lumina Converter seems intact. It’s about time we test it in real conditions."
"3","Spring Meadows","0","7","Gustave","Putain… Putain…"
"3","Spring Meadows","1","0","Lune","We did it, Gustave. Let’s see if your invention lives up to its reputation, shall we? It really works. We’re not dead yet."
"3","Spring Meadows","1","1","Gustave","Yeah."
"3","Spring Meadows","1","2","Lune","Come on. There might be other survivors at the Indigo Tree."
"3","Spring Meadows","4","0","Lune","Someone came here before and set up these handholds."
"3","Spring Meadows","4","1","Gustave","Probably Expedition 69, the climbers expedition."
"3","Spring Meadows","4","2","Lune","Let us thank them for that."
"3","Spring Meadows","5","0","Jar","(gibberish) (weepy mumble)"
"3","Spring Meadows","5","1","Lune","Something’s wrong with it. Why isn’t it attacking us?"
"3","Spring Meadows","5","2","Gustave","Well, it certainly attacked them. An expedition journal… 81. “Learn from the ones who came before…”"
"3","Spring Meadows","5","3","Lune","“… And lay the trail, for the ones who come after.”"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","0","Lune","They communicate with a Nevron?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","1","Gustave","The dead here don’t disappear, like in Lumière. Their chroma stays inside their bodies."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","2","Lune","On the beach… some did disappear."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","3","Gustave","He wasn’t a Nevron."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","4","Lune","Something about the way Nevrons kill seems to affect our chroma…"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","5","Gustave","Perhaps your friend here can enlighten us."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","6","Jar","(gibberish) Enlighten… Light… I need light…"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","7","Gustave","It really does speak."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","8","Lune","What do you mean, light?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","9","Gustave","Did you kill these people?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","10","Jar","(gibberish) I would never plunge others into darkness. I was painted to bring light."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","11","Lune","Painted? By the Paintress?"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","12","Jar","(gibberish) Paint-tress? Yes. She painted me. Help me… Find light."
"3","Spring Meadows","6","13","Lune","If we bring it light, perhaps we can learn more…"
"3","Spring Meadows","6","14","Gustave","I’m not sure that’s a good idea…"
"3","Spring Meadows","7","0","Lune","Flares!"
"3","Spring Meadows","7","1","Gustave","Survivors!"
"3","Spring Meadows","7","2","Lune","Hurry!"
"3","Spring Meadows","8","0","Gustave","LEO!"
"3","Spring Meadows","8","1","Lune","Fuck, it’s big. Fall back!"
"3","Spring Meadows","8","2","Gustave","Putain de merde!"
"3","Spring Meadows","9","0","Lune","Celebrate later. There’ll be others. We should be safe up in the tree."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","1","Gustave","Yeah. PUTAIN. Nobody."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","2","Lune","Wait. There’s a message on the wall—“Took Maelle to the weird corals. Head north. Look for a door inside a hut.”"
"3","Spring Meadows","9","3","Gustave","Maelle?"
"3","Spring Meadows","9","4","Lune","This doesn’t make sense. Who would have written this? It sounds like an Expeditioner, but everyone KNOWS to sign their messages."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","5","Gustave","Yeah, but they might’ve been in a hurry."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","6","Lune","I dunno. Doesn’t sound like anyone on the team. What if it’s a trap? The man on the beach–"
"3","Spring Meadows","9","7","Gustave","It’s a lead, our only lead. Whoever this is knows Maelle. We have to go."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","8","Lune","No, not yet. Protocol is to regroup at the Rally Point and wait three days. This message feels off. If it was an Expeditioner, they would have stayed here. Everyone knows the protocol."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","9","Gustave","Right, but they may have been in danger. Maybe this location has been compromised. Things change in the field."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","10","Lune","There’s a REASON it’s protocol."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","11","Gustave","Protocol doesn’t cover every contingency. You know that."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","12","Lune","There’s a REASON it’s protocol. We designed it to yield the optimal result in the vast majority of situations."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","13","Gustave","Was our entire team dying part of that “optimal result?” Look. I’m going after Maelle. Protocol also states “Never move solo.” I’ll let you choose which protocol to break."
"3","Spring Meadows","9","14","Lune","Merde."
"3","Spring Meadows","10","0","Lune","So. The message said head north. To the “weird corals.”"
"3","Spring Meadows","10","1","Gustave","And a door in a hut."
"3","Spring Meadows","10","2","Lune","It’s been a long day, we should make camp."
"3","Spring Meadows","10","3","Gustave","I’m fine. Let’s keep going."
"3","Spring Meadows","10","4","Lune","We won’t find Maelle if we’re dead."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","0","Gustave","I’m sorry about earlier. The beach was not your fault–"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","1","Lune","No, it was. I convinced Alan to land there."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","2","Gustave","So, uh… We can rest a bit, but the moon is bright, I want to keep moving."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","3","Lune","Have you learned nothing from the beach?"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","4","Gustave","I’m not leaving Maelle alone a minute longer than I have to."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","5","Lune","But right now, it’s just the two of us and I don’t want to bring Maelle your corpse. We have to think every step through. The man on the beach, you saw what he did. But more than that… You saw his face. He must be, what, 50? 60? Yet he survived the Gommage. We don’t know who we’re dealing with. We lost everyone in an instant–"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","6","Gustave","Exactly. He killed us all so easily, he doesn’t need to fake a message. Lucien– Lucien died to save me. And, and Tristan, Margot, they… they all… I am not letting Maelle die out here. I’m taking her home."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","7","Lune","What, No, no, no. We have a mission–"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","8","Gustave","Oh, fuck the mission! Fuck the mission, Lune. What are we gonna do, huh? Tell me. What are we gonna do? We’re gonna take down the Paintress, just the three of us? My… my gun and… and your sparks?"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","9","Lune","I didn’t take you for a coward."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","10","Gustave","I’m not a coward."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","11","Lune","You swore the oath. “When one falls. We. Continue.”"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","12","Gustave","Yes, I know."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","13","Lune","When one falls. WHEN one falls. Not if. When. We knew not all of us would make it. But “WE. CONTINUE.” As long as even one of us stands, our fight is not over."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","14","Gustave","But I’m not afraid to fight, it’s just Maelle, she’s–"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","15","Lune","Maelle swore the same oath."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","16","Gustave","I know that!"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","17","Lune","She chose her life! You and I… Come on… we always said the future of Lumière is more important than any–"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","18","Gustave","Than any individual life, yes."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","19","Lune","Yes, do you still believe that? Do you still believe that? Do you?"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","20","Gustave","I hope I do."
"3","Spring Meadows","11","21","Lune","“Fuck the mission.” Really?"
"3","Spring Meadows","11","22","Gustave","Sorry."
