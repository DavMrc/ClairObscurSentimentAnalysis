"22","Sacred River","0","0","Monoco","It is a beautiful evening. The colours in the sky. The shining of the stars. Tonight is a night full of promise."
"22","Sacred River","0","1","Verso","Is it?"
"22","Sacred River","0","2","Monoco","We shall bring Noco back."
"22","Sacred River","0","3","Verso","I thought you wanted to wait, until things calmed down?"
"22","Sacred River","0","4","Monoco","Who knows how much time tomorrow will allow. No. Let us give Noco the gift of today. It’s a simple journey to the Sacred River. We’re not far, it’s close to the Station."
"22","Sacred River","0","5","Verso","Golga won’t be happy that you’re jumping the queue again."
"22","Sacred River","0","6","Monoco","I’ll deal with Golga later. You helped me bring Noco back once before, will you help us again, my friend?"
"22","Sacred River","0","7","Verso","Always."
"22","Sacred River","2","0","Verso","Haven’t been here in a while."
"22","Sacred River","2","1","Monoco","The Sacred River. Let’s make haste, I don’t want her to…"
"22","Sacred River","2","2","Golgra","(gibberish) MONOCO! You’re trying to skip the queue again, you old… uh… old… lazy… retired warrior!"
"22","Sacred River","2","3","Monoco","How did you even know I was here?"
"22","Sacred River","2","4","Golgra","(gibberish) You’re carrying dozens of feet around. I can smell them from the other side of the continent."
"22","Sacred River","2","5","Monoco","Fair point."
"22","Sacred River","2","6","Golgra","(gibberish) We’ve been over this before. See all these Gestrals? They’re waiting in the queue like everyone else!"
"22","Sacred River","2","7","Monoco","It’s a stupid rule, we should just bring them all back now."
"22","Sacred River","2","8","Golgra","(gibberish) You know that would be CHAOS. There aren’t enough adult Gestrals to shepherd all the newborns. Plus I hate all the noise. Can you imagine a forest full of baby Gestrals?"
"22","Sacred River","2","9","Monoco","You leave me no choice then."
"22","Sacred River","2","10","Verso","Oh no… Think twice, Monoco."
"22","Sacred River","2","11","Monoco","I have already thought about it thrice. Golgra! I demand a trial by combat."
"22","Sacred River","2","12","Golgra","(gibberish) Humpf, I was hoping you’d say that."
"22","Sacred River","2","13","Verso","Do I have to participate?"
"22","Sacred River","2","14","Monoco","Please, help me."
"22","Sacred River","2","15","Verso","For Noco then."
"22","Sacred River","2","16","Golgra","(gibberish) May you both survive this."
"22","Sacred River","3","0","Golgra","(gibberish) Ah, it’s almost time for my squat session, it’s leg day. Sorry, I can’t finish this fight."
"22","Sacred River","3","1","Monoco","Oh, come on! You’re just afraid of losing."
"22","Sacred River","3","2","Verso","Monoco, please, shut up."
"22","Sacred River","3","3","Golgra","(gibberish) You did entertain me, so… I’ll let it slide this time, Monoco. Go ahead, bring him back."
"22","Sacred River","3","4","Monoco","I won’t say thank you. Thank you."
"22","Sacred River","4","0","Noco","(gibberish) Mo- Monoco?"
"22","Sacred River","4","1","Monoco","Ah. It’s good to hear your voice."
"22","Sacred River","4","2","Verso","Hey, Noco. How’s my favourite merchant?"
"22","Sacred River","4","3","Noco","(gibberish) … Golgra?"
"22","Sacred River","4","4","Golgra","(gibberish) …"
"22","Sacred River","4","5","Monoco","Golgra? Are you crying?"
"22","Sacred River","4","6","Golgra","(gibberish) I’m not."
"22","Sacred River","4","7","Noco","(gibberish) Can we go home?"
"22","Sacred River","4","8","Monoco","Not yet, I’m afraid. We have a mission. Do you remember our Expeditioner friends?"
"22","Sacred River","4","9","Noco","(gibberish) No?"
"22","Sacred River","4","10","Monoco","They’ll be happy to see you. They were very worried. Come, let’s go back to camp. We found many treasures for you to trade!"
"22","Sacred River","4","11","Noco","(gibberish) ………."
"22","Sacred River","4","12","Golgra","(gibberish) Let me take Noco to the Village. It’s always disorientating for the newly returned. Noco needs time to adjust. Noco, would you like to go back to the village?"
"22","Sacred River","4","13","Noco","(gibberish) …"
"22","Sacred River","4","14","Monoco","But I’m Noco’s guardian!"
"22","Sacred River","4","15","Verso","I know you want to keep Noco by your side. But it’s safer there. You’ll see Noco when we get back to the Village."
"22","Sacred River","4","16","Monoco","…"
"22","Sacred River","4","17","Noco","(gibberish) …"
"22","Sacred River","4","18","Monoco","Wait for me. I’ll be back as soon as I can."
"22","Sacred River","4","19","Golgra","(gibberish) Off we go then."
"22","Sacred River","4","20","Verso","He’ll be fine. Better than with you, that’s for sure."
"22","Sacred River","4","21","Monoco","That he will be. Thanks for helping. I never understood how Golgra got so freakishly strong."
"22","Sacred River","4","22","Verso","I could take Golgra by myself."
"22","Sacred River","4","23","Monoco","I will never show you weakness ever again."
"22","Sacred River","4","24","Verso","Come on, let’s get back to camp."
"22","Sacred River","6","0","Monoco","…"
"22","Sacred River","6","1","Verso","You ok?"
"22","Sacred River","6","2","Monoco","…"
"22","Sacred River","6","3","Verso","At least, Noco is safe, and can begin readjusting."
"22","Sacred River","6","4","Monoco","Every time he returns, he is slightly changed. I mourn the loss of who he was before. But he’s still there, my old mentor. Thank you, my friend."
"22","Sacred River","9","0","Monoco","…"
"22","Sacred River","9","1","Verso","Noco always said that he didn’t mind waiting in the queue. Why were you so adamant about bringing him back sooner?"
"22","Sacred River","9","2","Monoco","There was never supposed to be a queue. Verso—Verso wanted us to experience the excitement of new beginnings. He gave us the gift of the river. Why shouldn’t we use it?"
"22","Sacred River","9","3","Verso","…"
"22","Sacred River","9","4","Monoco","Noco found me after the Fracture. Noco raised me, taught me, protected me. It’s my turn to protect him, that’s how it works. He took care of me, now I take care of him. Except I can’t."
"22","Sacred River","9","5","Verso","Because of me."
"22","Sacred River","9","6","Monoco","I know why you’re doing this. And I know how it might end. I’m not gambling on tomorrow."
"22","Sacred River","9","7","Verso","Monoco—"
"22","Sacred River","9","8","Monoco","(tired exhale)"
"22","Sacred River","9","9","Verso","Why help me then? If—"
"22","Sacred River","9","10","Monoco","For Verso. And for you."
"22","Sacred River","9","11","Verso","My friend."
"22","Sacred River","9","12","Monoco","Verso gave us many new beginnings. He would have wanted a new beginning for you too. You deserve a new beginning, if you want one. Every one of us does."
"22","Sacred River","9","13","Verso","…"
"22","Sacred River","9","14","Monoco","Now come over here and let’s snuggle."
"22","Sacred River","9","15","Verso","Little spoon?"
"22","Sacred River","9","16","Monoco","Obviously."
