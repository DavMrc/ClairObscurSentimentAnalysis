"25","Painting Workshop","0","0","Faceless boy","(gibberish) A traveller here. Bathing in light. I have whispered my fears, yet she merely smiles, a secretive smile that hints at truths beyond my grasp. She tells me the night must be met with courage, that the heart must not falter. She crafts a beast, radiant yet fearsome, woven from the very essence of luminescence. It prowls the night, casting its spectral glow upon the darkened corners of my sanctuary. Will you put an end to her night?"
"25","Painting Workshop","0","1","Lune","We will."
"25","Painting Workshop","0","2","Faceless boy","(gibberish) A curious yet admirable pursuit. The beast has paid the price, and so shall its darkness shine once again. Farewell."
"25","Painting Workshop","2","0","Faceless boy","(gibberish) A lost soul, adrift in twilight. Her paintbrush wielded darkness, and from it, the monster emerged. She wove her spite into the canvas, birthing a horror to plague my nights. Your hand holds the power to unweave the terror she wove. You can dissolve the nightmare. Will you help me?"
"25","Painting Workshop","2","1","Lune","We will."
"25","Painting Workshop","2","2","Faceless boy","(gibberish) Remember, light and dark dance together. But light must lead."
"25","Painting Workshop","4","0","Faceless boy","(gibberish) A sister’s brush, a stroke of fear. The monster she painted… it lives in my night. Jealousy twists and love blinds. Her canvas conjured a nightmare, a creature to keep me awake. We must unmake what she created. For it does not belong here. Will you help me?"
"25","Painting Workshop","4","1","Lune","We will."
"25","Painting Workshop","4","2","Faceless boy","(gibberish) Seek the light within the dark. Her mind is a maze of twisted paths, but her heart knows the way. Farewell."
