"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","0","Sciel","Wanna go for a ride? Apparently that was where people went on dates, you know. What do you think happened in those cabins?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","1","Gustave","No, actually, my guess is this was Expedition 50. You see, they created this giant wheel and they tried to cross the world."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","2","Sciel","Okay, okay, professor."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","3","Esquie","Mes amis! Florrie is close, I can feel it!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","4","Maelle","Come on, you can fly, can’t you get Florrie yourself?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","5","Esquie","Oh no, too much effort."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","6","Gustave","So, wait. Esquie is that powerful?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","7","Sciel","Apparently so. But also lazy."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","8","Gustave","All right, let’s go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","0","9","Sciel","What a weird creature."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","1","0","Lune","A shrine to the Paintress."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","1","1","Gustave","The Paintress destroyed our world. And someone built her a shrine?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","1","2","Lune","The weak-minded turn to whatever they can to explain the unknown."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","1","3","Sciel","When you’re at the mercy of a power you don’t understand, you might try anything."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","4","0","Maelle","Easier than expected."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","4","1","Gustave","Hey don’t jinx us. No need to invite misfortune."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","4","2","Lune","I don’t see any stones."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","4","3","Maelle","What’s happening?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","4","4","Gustave","Misfortune."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","0","Maelle","Is it really dead?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","1","Gustave","Looks like it."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","2","Sciel","Is this it?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","3","Esquie","Ooooh! FLORRIE! All right! Ready to sail like a snail! Just jump, mes amis! It’s not that high!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","4","Lune","We can finally cross the sea."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","5","Sciel","You don’t happen to have some wine stashed away, do you?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","6","Esquie","Wine?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","7","Gustave","Hey, you can do this."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","8","Sciel","I hate water."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","9","Gustave","She doesn’t seem that far now, does she?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","10","Maelle","Yeah. Wanna throw one more rock?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","11","Gustave","The others are waiting, but…"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","12","Maelle","You might reach her."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","13","Gustave","Okay. Ooh, what about that one?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","14","Maelle","Does it really matter?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","15","Gustave","Well, you know, like I always say, it’s not about the rock, it’s more about the–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","16","Maelle","Gustave…"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","17","Gustave","Run."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","18","Maelle","Run… Please, run."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","19","Gustave","Why… Why are you doing this? We’ve done NOTHING to you. We should be on the same side. Let her go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","20","Sciel","Something’s going on up there."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","21","Lune","Esquie, get us up there!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","22","Esquie","I can’t!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","5","23","Lune","Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","6","0","Gustave","For those who come after, right?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","6","1","Maelle","No, no, no, no… You promised… GUSTAVE! Nonononono–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","6","2","White-haired man","You won’t yet understand. But this is a kindness, not a cruelty."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","0","Unknown woman","You let her come?! You know she’s too weak for this, how could you let her take such a risk?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","1","Unknown man","You only care when things are right in front of you. My sweet child, you were supposed to stay home. I told you not to worry. But since you’re here now, just stay put–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","2","Unknown woman","What are you saying? You must go home, NOW. This does not involve you."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","3","Unknown man","When this is over, we’ll go home together."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","7","4","Unknown woman","No!"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","0","White-haired man","This won’t make sense to you now, but we both want what’s best for our families. I’m sorry you’re caught in the middle. But I did try to warn you. It’s been a while. Stay out of this. You chose to walk away. You don’t get to come back now and interfere."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","1","Stranger","You’ve lived more than a lifetime. It’s time to let her go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","2","White-haired man","A lifetime. A lifetime with my family torn apart. No, I want my family back."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","3","Stranger","It’s not your family. But she is."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","4","White-haired man","You would use her?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","5","Stranger","She chose to come. I didn’t make the rules between you two. Hey, are you alright? It’s okay. I’ll handle things here. Get back to your friends. Go."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","6","White-haired man","So that’s it. You’ve set us down this path, but are you ready for the consequences?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","8","7","Stranger","She’ll never paint again."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","0","Sciel","Last time we sat together like this…"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","1","Lune","Mm. In Lumière. Mourning our parents."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","2","Sciel","Seems like everytime we’re together, it’s to grieve. I wish we could have spent more time… in less hopeless contexts."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","3","Lune","The plan doesn’t change. We aim for the Monolith. We keep heading north. With Esquie’s help, we can make it. But we lost the Lumina Converter–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","4","Sciel","It’s ok, we can think about that later–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","5","Lune","All the backups were destroyed by that MAN, but Expedition 32 will bring more, their chances will be better– We need to prepare them. I should update our journals–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","6","Sciel","Hey, hey, hey. It’s ok. Tomorrow will still come."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","7","Lune","Sciel–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","8","Stranger","This seemed important. If you want to reach the Monolith, the best path is through the quarry up north."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","9","Lune","Who are you?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","10","Sciel","And where did you get that expedition uniform?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","11","Stranger","Strange way to say thank you. Um. I’m sorry I couldn’t save your friend. I’m wearing an expedition uniform because I, too, am an Expeditioner–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","12","Sciel","What? What d’you mean, you’re an–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","13","Lune","I’ve never seen you before–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","14","Stranger","First Expedition. Expedition Zero."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","15","Lune","Expedition Zero? But how are you alive? And not–"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","16","Stranger","Old? I don’t know, exactly, but some of us stopped aging. And we’re not affected by the Gommage."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","17","Lune","“Some” of you. Like the man on the cliff."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","18","Stranger","Renoir. Our commander."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","19","Lune","Why? Why did he massacre our team?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","20","Sciel","How could he turn on his own people?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","21","Stranger","He believes his immortality is a gift from the Paintress. Killing her would kill him too. And he enjoys living forever."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","22","Lune","And you don’t?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","23","Stranger","Burying everyone you know while you live on… Can wear you down a bit. I couldn’t help your friend, but perhaps, I can help you."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","24","Lune","You want to join us?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","25","Stranger","If you don’t mind the company… Yes."
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","26","Maelle","So if I want to kill Renoir, I have to kill the Paintress first. What’s your name?"
"8","Stone Wave Cliffs","9","27","Stranger","Verso."
