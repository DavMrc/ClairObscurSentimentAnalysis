"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","0","Lucien","There you are! You can’t hide from us, you know. Like I said, mourning’s best done with friends."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","1","Catherine","Lucien."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","2","Lucien","What? It is. Grieving alone is the worst."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","3","Catherine","Where’s mine?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","4","Lucien","Santé, les amis!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","5","Catherine","Santé!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","6","Gustave","Yeah– Yeah, yeah, no, I could use a drink."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","7","Catherine","Five tables this year, you see that? Told you we’d beat the 34s. Even Maelle showed up, and she hates these things. Wanna go take a look?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","8","Gustave","Uh, I don’t– Maybe later. I’ll catch up. I’m okay. I’m okay. You go."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","9","Lucien","Yeah. Time for a refill anyway."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","10","Catherine","There’s an “excess of wine” again. Thank your sister for her generosity."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","11","Lucien","Oh, and try to enjoy yourself. Don’t drink alone, you weirdo!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","0","12","Gustave","Yeah, right. Enjoy myself. I should check on Maelle, she’s probably alone, as usual. Let’s at least check on Maelle and my apprentices."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","0","Gustave","I knew I’d find you here. Having second thoughts about the Expedition?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","1","Maelle","Please. I’m more ready to go than you are."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","2","Gustave","Yeah, I know."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","3","Maelle","…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","4","Gustave","I know we’ve been over this, but as your guardian, I need to say this one more time. The rest of us only have a year left, but you’ve got nine good years before your Gommage. You don’t need to leave yet. It’s a lot of risk."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","5","Maelle","One year out there’s better than nine years in here."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","6","Gustave","I know you think that but–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","7","Maelle","If anyone should stay, it’s you. You have friends and family who want you here–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","8","Gustave","So do you–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","9","Maelle","No, I don’t."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","10","Gustave","Emma thinks of you as family–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","11","Maelle","Lumière’s not my home. Not the way it is for you. Besides, this way I can keep an eye on you for Emma."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","12","Gustave","Right, ‘cause she needs eyes everywhere."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","13","Maelle","Shush. You’re lucky you have a sister who cares."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","14","Gustave","Doubly lucky, since now I have two."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","15","Maelle","Alright, enough chit chat. C’mon, old man, let’s have a duel."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","16","Gustave","“Old man?”"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","1","17","Maelle","You’re pretty much the oldest man in Lumière, now, non? C’mon. This time, I’m not messing around! Hope your Lumina Converter works better than your duelling."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","2","0","Gustave","Not bad for the oldest man in Lumière, eh?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","2","1","Maelle","Congratulations, you beat a teenager. Take this token as your well deserved prize. Don’t get too drunk tonight, okay?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","2","2","Gustave","Hmmm, where are my scallywag apprentices? I promised to find them at the festival."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","3","0","Jules","Wow, so many Expeditioners! So cool!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","0","Jules","That’s… He made that overnight? Dad… Damn, now I feel stupid for fighting with him… Dad…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","1","Gustave","…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","2","Jules","You take it."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","3","Gustave","What?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","4","Jules","I’m not sure I’ll ever use it. Maybe I’ll go blind like my father, or maybe another expedition will succeed. I want to support the Expedition now. Take it. It may be useful to you."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","5","Gustave","…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","6","Jules","It’s ok. I don’t need the uniform to know my dad’s with me."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","5","7","Gustave","Thanks."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","0","Michel","Come, let’s play some cards."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","1","Gustave","No way. Everyone knows you cheat."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","2","Michel","That’s just what sore losers say. Come now, you gonna be a little cautious mouse with the Paintress too?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","3","Gustave","“Cautious” is good. Keeps you alive."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","4","Michel","Meh. We’re EXPEDITIONERS. Stay smart, yes, but be BOLD, eh? You can’t win if you don’t play."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","5","Gustave","Money’s no good out there anyway. Why’re you trying to fleece me?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","6","6","Michel","‘Cause winning is fun."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","0","Seba","Gustave! Come drink with me!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","1","Gustave","I’m pacing myself tonight."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","2","Seba","Oh, you’re so boring. It’s our last night! Who knows when we’ll be back."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","3","Gustave","I like that you say “when” and not “if.”"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","7","4","Seba","What can I say? I’m an optimist. Or an idiot. Depends on who you ask."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","0","Tom","Hey, Gustave, check out the new Pictos I made!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","1","Gustave","Looks a bit rough. You sure it works?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","2","Tom","I’ve been working on this for months. It’s my personal masterpiece."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","3","Gustave","Your personal masterpiece seems a little… unorthodox."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","4","Tom","It’s dead useful, trust me. C’mon, give it a whirl."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","5","Gustave","Sure, why not…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","6","Tom","Great. I’ll trade it for one token."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","7","Gustave","Call it morbid curiosity. Here. Your token."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","8","8","Tom","You won’t regret it. Probably."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","0","Gustave","Hey, Amandine, having fun?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","1","Amandine","Oh, hey, handsome, perfect timing. I’m styling everyone before we ship out. Gotta look sharp when we hit the Paintress, eh?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","2","Gustave","Certainly important. Can you style me up too?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","9","3","Amandine","On it. Just bring me a token first."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","0","Antoine","Gustave, just the man I wanted to see."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","1","Gustave","You want a rematch, don’t you?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","2","Antoine","It’s my last chance, isn’t it?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","3","Gustave","After tomorrow, you’ll be the undisputed expert on Expedition history."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","4","Antoine","That’s tomorrow. What about today?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","5","Gustave","Who am I to deny you. Fire away."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","6","Antoine","How many years ago was the Fracture?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","7","Gustave","You’re kidding, this is your question?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","8","Antoine","Yes. When did our world break apart and our luminous city get thrown into the middle of the ocean? When was the Fracture?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","9","Gustave","67 years ago."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","10","Antoine","Brilliant. I concede. You are the undisputed expert on Lumieran History."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","11","Gustave","What are you talking about? Every child knows this. The Monolith’s essentially a reverse calendar, counting down since the Fracture happened in Year 100."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","12","Antoine","All right, fine, another one then. Which was the first expedition to depart for the continent?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","13","Gustave","Expedition Zero."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","14","Antoine","Correct. That still annoys me. They left in Year 100. They should be called Expedition 100. Makes no sense. Lumière will be long gone before the Monolith hits zero. Alright, last one. Get it right and maybe I’ll give you a token. What is a “Lumina?”"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","15","Gustave","Abilities you internalise by using a Pictos in battle after enough times."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","16","Antoine","Well done, well done."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","17","Gustave","Not really, I mean, I created the Lumina Converter… So…?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","18","Antoine","Ahem. I hereby officially end our feud. With your departure, Lumière loses a brilliant light. And a… good friend."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","19","Gustave","You big softie."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","12","20","Antoine","Alright, alright, here’s a token, go spend it on something."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","0","Colette","Hello there, Gustave. Perhaps one of these artefacts may prove useful to your mission?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","1","Gustave","Colette, you’ve been holding out on us. What are these?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","2","Colette","Relics from before the Fracture, passed down through the generations. The Council deemed them trinkets, but I think otherwise."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","3","Gustave","That’s kind of you to share."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","4","Colette","I may not be able to join the Expedition, but I’d still like to help. One token is all I ask."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","13","5","Gustave","Ah. I should’ve known."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","0","Gustave","These are yours?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","1","Sciel","You gonna lecture ME on drinking?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","2","Gustave","I wouldn’t dare. Just calculating how much it’ll hurt to catch up."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","3","Sciel","You can start now. Here, let’s have a toast. To Sophie. Who was always… unapologetically Sophie. My fierce and loving friend."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","4","Gustave","To Soph. Seriously, though, this is gonna hurt tomorrow."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","5","Sciel","Mmmm. “Tomorrow comes” but I ain’t here yet. I’m not crossing the sea sober."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","6","Gustave","Sober’s better than deathly hungover."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","7","Sciel","No, not for that."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","8","Gustave","Ah."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","14","9","Sciel","Go have some drinks."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","0","Gustave","Commander."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","1","Alan","Gustave. Saw you with Sophie. You talked?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","2","Gustave","Yeah. I– Yeah. Where’s your daughter?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","3","Alan","Léona’s upset. Doesn’t want to see me."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","4","Gustave","Shit."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","5","Alan","It’s ok. She doesn’t need to understand. As long as she gets to live."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","6","Gustave","Yeah."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","7","Alan","I’m counting on you."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","8","Gustave","No pressure."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","9","Alan","Oh, no. LOTS of pressure. You and Lune and your Lumina tech. That’s our edge."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","10","Gustave","I’m– Thanks, but– That’s not– Everyone has a role. Lucien, Tristan, Catherine. And YOU. You made us into a– We have a really good team, thanks to you. That’s our edge."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","11","Alan","“Tomorrow comes,” my friend."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","15","12","Gustave","Doesn’t it always."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","0","Jérôme","Think there’s other survivor out there?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","1","Gustave","Doubtful. We would’ve seen signs."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","2","Jérôme","But not impossible. Maybe if they have Shield Domes. But they would’ve been overrun by Nevrons before they could be any."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","3","Gustave","We were lucky the Fracture dropped us out here. Bought us time to get our defences up."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","4","Jérôme","I dunno. People are resourceful. And Nevrons can’t be everywhere. I’m betting on human ingenuity."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","16","5","Gustave","I like that."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","0","Gustave","You came."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","1","Lucie","I wasn’t sure if I should."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","2","Gustave","You’ve been avoiding us. You didn’t have to."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","3","Lucie","Mm. I heard Seba filled my spot. After I left."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","4","Gustave","Yeah."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","5","Lucie","D’you think I’m a coward for staying?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","6","Gustave","Do you?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","7","Lucie","Not anymore. Not all of us can change the world. Some of us can only change ourselves."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","8","Gustave","Meaning what? Make yourself accept the unacceptable? Make believe that happiness is… this?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","9","Lucie","More like… rediscover. Happiness. One Gommage left. Maybe contentment is the highest form of happiness."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","10","Gustave","It makes me sad to hear you talk like this. The Paintress stole so many things, including your capacity to dream."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","11","Lucie","No, you misunderstand. My mind is where I can be free. She can’t touch me there. This is my final act of defiance. Just like the Expedition is yours."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","17","12","Gustave","If you say so."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","0","Tristan","I just finished calibrating the Lumina Converter. We can launch test runs as soon as we land."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","1","Gustave","Perfect."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","2","Tristan","Hey. Does Lune seem preoccupied to you? She’s been distant lately."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","3","Gustave","Well. It’s Lune."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","4","Tristan","Mm. This feels different."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","5","Gustave","I haven’t noticed anything, but you know her better. Have you talked to her?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","6","Tristan","Nah, she doesn’t like people prying. I’ve known her since we were six. She hates personal questions."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","7","Gustave","Ah right, you were both apprenticed to her parents."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","8","Tristan","Yeaahh. Let’s just say, they ran a tight ship."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","18","9","Gustave","Mmm. I can imagine."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","0","Bastien","Ready for tomorrow?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","1","Gustave","Yeah– Been ready. What about you? Heard you were elected “Commander 32.” Congrats."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","2","Bastien","I’ve already claimed Alan’s office. It’s got a nicer view than mine."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","3","Gustave","A view of the Paintress? You’re sicker than I thought."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","4","Bastien","She won’t be there for long."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","5","Gustave","Mmmm. If we– If we fail though…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","19","6","Bastien","“When one falls, we continue.” We’ll pick up, and we’ll push on. But I know. We will meet again."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","0","Gustave","I can’t believe you’re working right now."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","1","Lune","Mm. Tristan dragged me here."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","2","Gustave","Is that the final spot? It’s amazing you triangulated Expedition Zero’s landing site."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","3","Lune","Theoretically. I extrapolated from the archives, but… it was 67 years ago. So much of the landscape has changed."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","4","Gustave","I trust your calculations."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","5","Lune","Thanks."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","6","Gustave","It’s a good strategy, retracing their steps. They’re the only expedition with any survivors, and they made it to the Monolith so…"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","7","Lune","Assuming the records are correct, my calculations are correct, that they left clear markers, that the road conditions haven’t changed–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","8","Gustave","You need a drink."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","20","9","Lune","Go away, Gustave."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","0","Gustave","Hey."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","1","Catherine","Hey yourself. You ok? Wanna talk about it?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","2","Gustave","Yeah, umm. Actually, no."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","3","Catherine","That’s ok."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","4","Gustave","What about you? You say goodbye to Derrick?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","5","Catherine","Oh, that was over ages ago."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","6","Gustave","Oh. Sorry–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","7","Catherine","Eh."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","8","Gustave","–I really thought you guys would work out."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","9","Catherine","It’s for the best. I need full focus on the Expedition. And our team. We’re all we have."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","21","10","Gustave","Yeah, we’re all we have."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","0","Lucien","Glass of wine? Or a hug?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","1","Gustave","Keep your sweat to yourself."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","2","Lucien","Bring Gustave a glass of wine!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","3","Gustave","Who, exactly, are you talking to? They cut servers from the budget years ago."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","4","Lucien","Ah. The ultimate indignity. A farewell party where we serve ourselves. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","5","Gustave","Mmmm. I’m betting you’ve got another bottle stashed in your coat somewhere. You gonna share?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","6","Lucien","You wound me. But yes, in fact, I do have a bottle. “Always be prepared.” Or was it “Always bring backup?” Eh. Same difference."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","7","Gustave","Right."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","8","Lucien","And I AM prepared! Prepared to live. AND. Prepared to die."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","9","Gustave","You’re such an idiot."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","10","Lucien","Hey. Heyheyheyheyhey. We’ve got your Lumina Converter, yeah? I. BELIEVE. I’m ready for my Lumina!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","11","Gustave","Yeah, well, we’ve only tested it here. Who knows what we’ll meet on the main continent. We’ll need more field-testing once we land."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","12","Lucien","Don’t worry, buddy. I’ve got you covered."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","22","13","Gustave","Great. Thanks, buddy."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","0","Alexandre","Gustave! We got something for you. For your field notes. So when you come back, you can tell us EVERYTHING. They’ll definitely want that for the Museum! The complete record of the Expedition that DESTROYED the Paintress!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","1","Guillaume","Oh, and if you find journals from the other Expeditions, make sure you save them for us!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","2","Gustave","I shall faithfully record ALL of our adventures. Every strange and wondrous thing."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","3","Alexandre","And Nevrons!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","4","Gustave","I can do that. And in return, do you solemnly promise to take care of the Shield Dome while I’m gone? I’m entrusting you with the safety of Lumière."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","5","Alexandre","I promise."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","6","Guillaume","Promise!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","7","Gustave","Adrien?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","8","Adrien","I’ll use everything you taught us, Monsieur G."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","9","Alexandre","Oh, hey, Gustave, your sister’s here!"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","23","10","Gustave","Yeah, I have to go talk to her. Take care of each other."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","0","Gustave","My darling sister has arrived, she’ll kill me if I don’t say goodbye. The Chief Councilor honours us with her presence. What? You still mad I’m going?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","1","Emma","This is the definition of a fool’s quest, and my brother’s not usually a fool."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","2","Gustave","I’ve heard you say otherwise."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","3","Emma","You and I both know the political complexities that necessitate the Expedition. It’s vital for morale, but it’s a bloodless guillotine, is what it is–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","4","Gustave","You should put that in your speech. Very motivating. They might just find a guillotine for you too."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","5","Emma","There are so many things you can contribute to HERE, in Lumière. That’ll have a REAL impact."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","6","Gustave","Em. You’re doing great work– Really. Getting things ready for the Last Generation– You’ve got it well in-hand here. Let me do my part, out there, and win us a chance to LIVE."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","7","Emma","We’re never going to see each other again."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","12","Gustave","Don’t you have a speech to give?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","13","Emma","You mean the one you so kindly wrote to me?"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","14","Gustave","Just suggestions! I thought it might help you understand–"
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","24","15","Emma","I do. Understand. I just– Anyway. Yeah, time for my speech."
"1","Festival de l’Expédition","26","0","Emma","Expeditioners. The Sword of Lumière. We honour your dedication. We do not take for granted that you dedicate your final year of life to keeping hope alive for all of Lumière. Some of you are leaving to change the world. Others to discover the secrets of our universe. Some to protect loved ones. Others to find meaning in our all-too-short lives. As you sail into the unknown, know that Lumière stands with you. When you battle the Paintress, know that Lumière fights with you. Let the stones of her Monolith crumble. Let her body lie at the end of the world, unable to paint another death. Let the stars no longer be hidden by her oppressive silhouette. Let the world once again watch the sun rise without the shadow of her cursed figure. May the wind of renewal take you to the ends of the earth. Tomorrow comes. Thanks to you, Expedition 33."
