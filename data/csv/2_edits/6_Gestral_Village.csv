"6","Gestral Village","3","0","Lune","It’s… it’s really a village of Gestrals!"
"6","Gestral Village","3","1","Gustave","They seem better at surviving than humans."
"6","Gestral Village","3","2","Maelle","I guess intelligence is not a prerequisite for survival on the continent. Now to find the chief’s house. Probably the biggest one."
"6","Gestral Village","4","1","Golgra","(gibberish) So YOU’RE the warriors who demolished our ULTIMATE Sakapatate?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","2","Maelle","It wasn’t that strong."
"6","Gestral Village","4","3","Golgra","(gibberish) Hmmmm. I see. Well. You’ve earned my respect. What can I do for you?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","4","Lune","Are you the “Chef?”"
"6","Gestral Village","4","5","Golgra","(gibberish) I am indeed the “Chef” of our village. The name’s Golgra."
"6","Gestral Village","4","6","Lune","There are so many questions I’d love to ask–"
"6","Gestral Village","4","7","Gustave","We need to get to the Paintress. Noco said you could help us cross the sea?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","8","Golgra","(gibberish) Humans. Still so obsessed with the Paintress."
"6","Gestral Village","4","9","Lune","Others have passed through here?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","10","Golgra","(gibberish) A few of your expeditions, every few years. Hard to keep track. Hmmm. Do you not have your own boat? How did you get here in the first place?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","11","Lune","A white-haired man destroyed it."
"6","Gestral Village","4","12","Golgra","(gibberish) And you survived? My respect."
"6","Gestral Village","4","13","Lune","You know him?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","14","Golgra","(gibberish) He attacked the village once. Some of us survived. Somehow. Mmm. Ok. You have no boat. In that case, your best bet is Esquie. If you ask nicely, maybe Esquie can take you across the water."
"6","Gestral Village","4","15","Lune","So Esquie exists!"
"6","Gestral Village","4","16","Golgra","(gibberish) Of course! Esquie lives not far from here. But only the greatest warriors are allowed through. You need a password."
"6","Gestral Village","4","17","Maelle","Why?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","18","Golgra","(gibberish) Esquie is very friendly, but Esquie could also accidentally eat you. Esquie doesn’t know its own strength sometimes. It would be irresponsible to let weaklings visit Esquie."
"6","Gestral Village","4","19","Maelle","We already defeated your Ultimate Sakapatate."
"6","Gestral Village","4","20","Golgra","(gibberish) Not. Good. Enough. You’ll have to enter our Legendary Tournament to get the password. This is the Gestral way. You will be fighting our Legendary Warriors. They are old so it should be easy."
"6","Gestral Village","4","22","Golgra","(gibberish) Now I’m excited. Let’s see what you can do. Oh, and you’ll also fight the Stranger. Yeah, that will be fun."
"6","Gestral Village","4","23","Lune","The Stranger?"
"6","Gestral Village","4","24","Golgra","(gibberish) Okay, enough talk. Go fight now. Do you want to go to the arena directly or do you want to beat up a few gestrals around here first?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","1","Maelle","Wait– That’s–"
"6","Gestral Village","49","2","Gustave","Sciel?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","3","Sciel","What– How– You guys– You’re alive! I thought I was the only one left– I knew you were resourceful."
"6","Gestral Village","49","4","Lune","How did you get here?"
"6","Gestral Village","49","5","Gestral announcer","(gibberish) Hey, humans! We’re here to see some fighting! If you don’t wanna fight, we’ll come down and fight ourselves!"
"6","Gestral Village","49","6","Sciel","They’re expecting a bit of a show. Shall we?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","0","Maelle","Well, that wasn’t so bad."
"6","Gestral Village","50","1","Gustave","Yeah, really just felt like beating old people."
"6","Gestral Village","50","2","Maelle","So it wasn’t so bad."
"6","Gestral Village","50","3","Sciel","Am I one of those old people?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","4","Gustave","One day, I hope. Hey, how’d you end up here?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","5","Sciel","Oh, um. After the beach– I ended up in an odd yellow forest, not too far from here. Had to dodge a few Nevrons. But luckily, I met a Gestral who guided me here. What about you?"
"6","Gestral Village","50","6","Gustave","Um… Well, I– I woke up near to a waterfall and–"
"6","Gestral Village","50","7","Lune","We can talk later. Let’s go back to Golgra."
"6","Gestral Village","50","8","Gustave","No time to lose."
"6","Gestral Village","51","0","Golgra","(gibberish) You return as champions. Well done, well done. Ok then, you ready? The password is– “Get outta my way.”"
"6","Gestral Village","51","1","Maelle","The password is “get outta my way?”"
"6","Gestral Village","51","2","Sciel","Very gestral-ish."
"6","Gestral Village","51","3","Golgra","(gibberish) Esquie’s Nest is east of the Village. Sunniso guards the path. Shout the password as loud as you can and Sunniso will let you through."
"6","Gestral Village","51","4","Sciel","“As loud as we can.” Got it."
"6","Gestral Village","51","5","Gustave","Thank you. For everything."
"6","Gestral Village","51","6","Golgra","(gibberish) Try not to die too soon."
"6","Gestral Village","51","7","Maelle","Gestral positivity is so heart-warming."
"6","Gestral Village","51","8","Golgra","(gibberish) One more thing. We’ve opened the back door for you. It’ll be easier to come back and visit us."
"6","Gestral Village","51","9","Sciel","Thanks, Chief."
"6","Gestral Village","52","0","Sciel","I still can’t believe it. I lost hope after a while, but you all survived."
"6","Gestral Village","52","1","Gustave","What was your plan if we hadn’t? Be a gestral champion until your Gommage?"
"6","Gestral Village","52","2","Sciel","Well, it was a lot of fun so, yeah, maybe?"
"6","Gestral Village","53","0","Lune","Noco’s quite obsessed with your arm. Your apprentices will be extremely proud knowing a Gestral loves their work."
"6","Gestral Village","53","1","Gustave","Yeah, they’d be insanely excited."
"6","Gestral Village","53","2","Lune","Well, they did a great job designing your arm. It was quite a creative assignement you gave them."
"6","Gestral Village","53","3","Gustave","Well, when life gives you lemons…"
"6","Gestral Village","53","4","Lune","Losing an arm is quite a lemon."
"6","Gestral Village","53","5","Gustave","Yeah, it’s not limonade."
"6","Gestral Village","53","6","Lune","(laughs)"
"6","Gestral Village","55","0","Gustave","You okay? You’ve been quiet since we left the Village."
"6","Gestral Village","55","1","Sciel","Yeah. Sorry… Bad memories."
"6","Gestral Village","55","2","Gustave","Wanna talk about it?"
"6","Gestral Village","55","3","Sciel","Hm, no."
"6","Gestral Village","55","4","Gustave","Hm, nah…"
"6","Gestral Village","55","5","Sciel","I’m glad you’re here."
"6","Gestral Village","55","6","Gustave","I would never abandon a member of Aquafarm 3."
"6","Gestral Village","55","7","Sciel","Aquafarm 3. That was so long ago. You and Sophie were inseparable on that project."
"6","Gestral Village","55","8","Gustave","Yeah, we were."
"6","Gestral Village","55","9","Sciel","It was a good project. It fed so many neighbourhoods at once. Kinda nostalgic, thinking back. We really thought we were making a difference."
"6","Gestral Village","55","10","Gustave","Hey, we’re still making a différence."
"6","Gestral Village","55","11","Sciel","Yes. Of course!"
"6","Gestral Village","55","12","Gustave","Yeah…"
"6","Gestral Village","58","0","Sciel","I can’t believe it. We’re gonna meet THE Esquie."
"6","Gestral Village","58","1","Lune","The Gestrals. And Esquie. The tales are true."
"6","Gestral Village","58","2","Maelle","Do you feel someth– White hair… Who are you?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","3","White-haired man","Alicia. I told you to stay home. It’s not good for you to see this. Yes. Yes, I understand. It’s her fault and she doesn’t even know it. But you can’t be here."
"6","Gestral Village","58","4","Maelle","What are you talking about? What’s my fault?! What is this?!"
"6","Gestral Village","58","5","White-haired man","You should never have come. You’re only going to make things worse. For everyone. Now take your friends and go home. Let them spend their final year in peace. This is your only warning."
"6","Gestral Village","58","6","Sciel","I can’t wait to see–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","7","Gustave","Maelle? Hey, hey, hey…"
"6","Gestral Village","58","8","Maelle","It was him! It was him! The white-haired man– and this woman–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","9","Gustave","Wai– Where– What are you talking about?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","10","Lune","Maelle, breathe. Slow down. What did you see? Think carefully. Every detail could be important."
"6","Gestral Village","58","11","Maelle","He said– He said we need to go… home. And that it’s– It’s my fault? That I’m– I’m gonna make things… worse. For everyone. You were all– frozen. I couldn’t– I couldn’t– It was like– a waking nightmare."
"6","Gestral Village","58","12","Gustave","It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s over."
"6","Gestral Village","58","13","Lune","What else? You said there was a woman?"
"6","Gestral Village","58","14","Sciel","Lune, maybe later."
"6","Gestral Village","58","15","Maelle","She– She had a mask– And–"
"6","Gestral Village","58","16","Lune","I know this is hard, but I need you to focus, okay? While the details are fresh."
"6","Gestral Village","58","17","Gustave","Lune. Ask her tomorrow. Hey, hey. Breathe. Silent to me. You’re safe. Do you understand? Okay? It’s over."
"6","Gestral Village","59","0","Gustave","Feeling better?"
"6","Gestral Village","59","1","Maelle","Yeah–"
"6","Gestral Village","59","2","Lune","We can debrief along the way. Let’s head east to Esquie’s Nest."
