"11","Monoco’s Station","0","0","Verso","Follow the tracks, they’ll lead us to Monoco."
"11","Monoco’s Station","0","1","Maelle","A train. Gustave would have liked to see that."
"11","Monoco’s Station","0","2","Lune","Is it true, before the Fracture, Lumière had trains running throughout the continent?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","0","3","Verso","Always running late, but running, yes."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","0","Verso","If Monoco’s not here, that means– Slow as ever, mon vieux."

"11","Monoco’s Station","2","6","Monoco","Ladies. Could I OW– interest you in a duel?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","7","Maelle","Yep, definitely a Gestral."
"11","Monoco’s Station","2","8","Verso","No point trying to talk until we’ve calmed Monoco down with a “relaxing” fight. Be careful though, Monoco’s fighting style is a bit… peculiar."

"11","Monoco’s Station","3","5","Noco","(gibberish) Oh, yeah! A Stalact is approaching! The Grandis are taking cover. Come on, come on!"

"11","Monoco’s Station","4","0","Monoco","Friends of Verso. As “Honoured Guests,” the first fight is yours! Defeat the Stalact with your fearsome talents!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","4","1","Sciel","Right. Oh. You’re serious."
"11","Monoco’s Station","4","2","Verso","Yes, he is. You little coward."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","0","Monoco","You’ve found worthy friends, Verso."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","1","Verso","Jealous?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","2","Sciel","What are you doing?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","3","Monoco","I just need… the foot. Ahah!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","4","Verso","He transforms by collecting Nevron feet. Don’t ask me how it works, I’ve never understood."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","5","Monoco","Now that we’ve had some good battles to warm the spirits, to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","6","Verso","We are heading for Old Lumière."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","7","Monoco","Ok, bye."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","8","Verso","Hey, come on. Hey! Hey, look, I know we failed before, but– Look, you doofus, don’t you recognize her?"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","9","Monoco","Of course, I do–"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","10","Verso","Then you know what that means. This our shot, it might be our only shot."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","11","Monoco","This is YOUR only shot. Out of question. I will never join you again."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","12","Verso","There will be a lot of fighting though."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","13","Monoco","Oh yeah, that’s true."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","14","Verso","Yeah, that’s true."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","15","Monoco","There will be a lot of fighting."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","16","Verso","Exactly."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","17","Monoco","Count me in then."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","18","Verso","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","19","Monoco","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","20","Verso","Good."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","21","Monoco","Good."

"11","Monoco’s Station","5","23","Maelle","Noco’s coming too."
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","24","Verso","You are???"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","25","Noco","(gibberish) Not a lot of merchants go to Old Lumière! There will be tons of rare shiny treasure and then I shall be– THE UNDISPUTED. TOP. MERCHANT. IN THE WORLD!"
"11","Monoco’s Station","5","26","Monoco","As a responsible parent, this is a superb idea. Let us go. To Old Lumière."
