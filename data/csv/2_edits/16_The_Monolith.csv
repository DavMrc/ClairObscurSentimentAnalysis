"16","The Monolith","2","0","Lune","Maelle, you should do the honours."
"16","The Monolith","2","1","Maelle","(screams)"
"16","The Monolith","3","0","Maelle","We can– We can do this. For Gustave."
"16","The Monolith","3","1","Lune","For all of them."
"16","The Monolith","4","0","Lune","Our attacks do nothing!"
"16","The Monolith","4","1","Verso","I don’t understand, the Gradient Attacks should work– Wait, Maelle."
"16","The Monolith","4","2","Maelle","I don’t think this is the–"
"16","The Monolith","4","3","Verso","No, nononono."
"16","The Monolith","4","4","Lune","Everybody okay?"
"16","The Monolith","4","5","Verso","Follow her. Quickly."
"16","The Monolith","4","6","Lune","What?"
"16","The Monolith","4","7","Verso","This might be our only chance."
"16","The Monolith","4","8","Lune","Yeah. Ok."
"16","The Monolith","5","0","Lune","We are… inside the Monolith… What was that thing? Why did it help us inside?"
"16","The Monolith","5","1","Verso","…"
"16","The Monolith","5","2","Sciel","Are you alright, Maelle?"
"16","The Monolith","5","3","Maelle","Up– Up there– She’s– The Paintress– She’s up there."
"16","The Monolith","5","4","Verso","What do you mean?"
"16","The Monolith","5","5","Maelle","I don’t know, but I can sense– The real Paintress– Her heart is above us somewhere."
"16","The Monolith","5","6","Lune","I guess we head up then."
"16","The Monolith","6","0","Lune","Verso, what was that?"
"16","The Monolith","6","1","Verso","I don’t know…"
"16","The Monolith","6","2","Maelle","Fire. Again."
"16","The Monolith","7","0","Lune","Again…"
"16","The Monolith","7","1","Maelle","…"
"16","The Monolith","7","2","Lune","Teaching her children to paint, huh…"
"16","The Monolith","8","0","Lune","Who is she fighting?"
"16","The Monolith","8","1","Sciel","Her husband?"
"16","The Monolith","9","0","Maelle","We’re inside her mind… These are memories…"
"16","The Monolith","9","1","Lune","How do you know that?"
"16","The Monolith","9","2","Maelle","The Chroma here… I can “read” it."
"16","The Monolith","11","0","Lune","I don’t understand…"
"16","The Monolith","11","1","Sciel","Verso, you ok?"
"16","The Monolith","11","2","Verso","Yeah, fine. Let’s keep moving, we’re almost at the top."
"16","The Monolith","12","0","Maelle","Is that- You…"
"16","The Monolith","12","1","Verso","We’re taking her down."
"16","The Monolith","12","2","Renoir","She’s not the only one who grieves. The pain of losing you… She made me inherit it. Punishment, perhaps, for not being there when it mattered. I refuse to lose my son."
"16","The Monolith","12","3","Verso","That son was a stranger."
"16","The Monolith","12","4","Renoir","But you’re not. You’re not."
"16","The Monolith","12","5","Verso","You lost me years ago. And I lost you."
"16","The Monolith","12","6","Renoir","So you leave us no choice? How are you different from her in doing this?"
"16","The Monolith","12","7","Verso","I’m tired."
"16","The Monolith","12","8","Renoir","So trust me. We are your family."
"16","The Monolith","12","9","Verso","Family is… complicated."
"16","The Monolith","12","10","Renoir","If saving you means losing you, then so be it."
"16","The Monolith","12","11","Verso","We only need to incapacitate him."
"16","The Monolith","12","12","Maelle","We’ll find a way to kill him."
"16","The Monolith","13","0","Renoir","Remember who your REAL family is. It’s not her. It’s your sister. Your mother. Me. WE are your family. You would condemn us all to die, for what? Who do you really save with your sacrifice?"
"16","The Monolith","13","1","Maelle","Your sister. And… your mother…"
"16","The Monolith","13","2","Verso","You’re too drunk on your own illusion to understand."
"16","The Monolith","13","3","Renoir","Then let us celebrate the second destruction of the Dessendre family. At long last, we meet. This is all you have left of your son. Destroying it won’t bring your wife back. It will only destroy the last tie you have to each other. I love them too."
"16","The Monolith","13","4","Maelle","We did it, Gustave–"
"16","The Monolith","13","5","Lune","Hey. How did you do that?"
"16","The Monolith","13","6","Maelle","I’m not sure. The Curator– I felt it–"
"16","The Monolith","13","7","Lune","Can you do it again?"
"16","The Monolith","13","8","Maelle","I don’t know– uh. I think so? Yeah, yeah I think I can."
"16","The Monolith","13","9","Sciel","What did Renoir mean? The things he said to the Curator."
"16","The Monolith","13","10","Verso","I’m– I’m not sure."
"16","The Monolith","13","11","Maelle","She’s through there."
"16","The Monolith","13","12","Lune","Yeah. Behind this door is the future of Lumière. What every expedition has worked towards. I have trust… in us."
"16","The Monolith","14","0","Lune","We’re… outside?"
"16","The Monolith","14","1","Maelle","She’s there– I can feel her."
"16","The Monolith","14","2","Monoco","We need to be as prepared as possible. Once we go up, there’s no turning back."
"16","The Monolith","15","0","Maelle","That’s her. The Paintress."
"16","The Monolith","15","1","Sciel","She looks like the Curator."
"16","The Monolith","15","2","Lune","Renoir. He mentioned the Curator’s wife. She’s the Paintress?"
"16","The Monolith","15","3","The Paintress","You’ve come– back– But the fire– Are you really here? Or is He–? Oh… is he playing tricks again? Alicia…"
"16","The Monolith","15","4","Lune","Alicia?"
"16","The Monolith","15","5","The Paintress","Your face–"
"16","The Monolith","15","6","Maelle","My face? What about my face? Are you going to burn it again?"
"16","The Monolith","15","7","Lune","Alicia’s your daughter."
"16","The Monolith","15","8","Sciel","And Maelle reminds you of her. The daughter you lost."
"16","The Monolith","15","9","The Paintress","Come along. Let’s go home."
"16","The Monolith","15","10","Verso","Yes. You need to go home."
"16","The Monolith","15","11","The Paintress","This is another trick. She’s not Alicia. You are not my Verso."
"16","The Monolith","15","12","Verso","No, Verso’s dead."
"16","The Monolith","15","13","The Paintress","No, no, you are HIS creations, not mine. You will not take this Canvas from me!"
"16","The Monolith","15","14","Verso","This is what we created the Expeditions for."
"16","The Monolith","15","15","Lune","Tomorrow comes."
"16","The Monolith","15","16","The Paintress","How cruel of your father to use you like this."
"16","The Monolith","16","0","Verso","Merde! I don’t like this. Esquie! Look what I found."
"16","The Monolith","16","1","Esquie","Oooooh! SOARRIE! Whoooohooo! All aboard!"
"16","The Monolith","16","2","Lune","Let’s go."
"16","The Monolith","16","3","The Paintress","Renoir can grieve however he likes. But I get to grieve my own way."
"16","The Monolith","18","0","The Paintress","Why?"
"16","The Monolith","18","1","Verso","Rest now. Things’ll be better soon."
"16","The Monolith","18","2","The Paintress","Alicia."
"16","The Monolith","18","3","Sciel","It’s… over. The number–"
"16","The Monolith","18","4","Lune","She’s gone."
"16","The Monolith","18","5","Monoco","It’s done. You’re free. You are all free."
"16","The Monolith","18","6","Maelle","Is this real?"
"16","The Monolith","18","7","Sciel","Yeah. And I’m pretty sure Gustave’s watching over us. Hey, come– Wanna plant it?"
"16","The Monolith","18","8","Lune","Though presumably, there will be no one coming after, right?"
"16","The Monolith","18","9","Sciel","It’s symbolic!"
"16","The Monolith","18","10","Maelle","Let’s… let’s go home."
"16","The Monolith","18","11","Sciel","Yeah."
"16","The Monolith","19","0","Sciel","Still feel immortal?"
"16","The Monolith","19","1","Verso","No less than yesterday."
"16","The Monolith","19","2","Sciel","Shall we test it out?"
"16","The Monolith","19","3","Verso","I appreciate the offer."
"16","The Monolith","19","4","Sciel","Monoco. You’ve been extra quiet since we got to the Monolith."
"16","The Monolith","19","5","Monoco","Have I?"
"16","The Monolith","19","6","Maelle","What now? We go back to Lumière and… life goes on?"
"16","The Monolith","19","7","Sciel","Yeah. Decades and decades in front of us. Guess this is how it feels to be immortal. What do we do now with all this time?"
"16","The Monolith","19","8","Lune","The Expedition might be over… But we’re not done yet. There are so many questions left to answer."
"16","The Monolith","19","9","Esquie","LUMIERE… LUMIERE AHEAD! OOOOH!"
"16","The Monolith","20","0","Alicia","Brother, I tire of the conflicts and deceptions that plague our family and theirs. So I entrust you with this letter. Whether you give it to her is up to you. I’m at peace with what’s to come. When the time comes, I hope you will be too."
"16","The Monolith","21","0","Alicia","Maelle. It’s a strange feeling, watching you with my brother. Laughing and smiling. Without the scars or the memories that afflict me. Alicia – as she was meant to be. Not this painted version that I am. My family, a facsimile of yours. And this world, a mirror. Painted by our mother, the Paintress, to stave off her grief."
"16","The Monolith","22","0","Alicia","Seeing your expedition through would plunge us all into the abyss. For in ridding the world of the Paintress… You’d lose the sole force standing against the one who would erase us. The one who invokes the flowers of the Gommage. An act of love. For he does love her. Your Father."
"16","The Monolith","23","0","Alicia","On her Monolith, she paints a warning for us all. Of the few she can save as her power wanes. We all wish for our families to thrive. Your family, however, believes only one can survive. But perhaps you’ll find another way. You who have lived amongst us. Perhaps you differ from your father and your father, as I differ from mine. Your mother paints life. While your father, death. What will you paint?"
